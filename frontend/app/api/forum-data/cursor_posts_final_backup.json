        "text": "Personally, one thing I never understood (and also can’t find info about this in the documentation) is how context handling works exactly.\nLet’s say I’m using the chat and providing a few files as context along my message. Do I still need to reference these files in my next message if I want to continue working with them, or do they remain relevant throughout the entire conversation? My experience regarding this has been inconsistent - sometimes I don’t need to provide the file in order for the llm to still remember it (makes sense, I assume its relevant parts are still in its context), but sometimes it can’t see them even if I make sure to attach them.\nI’m also unsure how much I need to worry about overloading the llm’s context, as I don’t know what happens to these attached files under the hood. For this reason I found myself using the codebase search (ctrl+enter in chat) less and less as I don’t want to confuse the llm and drown out the previous messages. I would like to know if all that happens is that all of those found files get thrown into the conversation, or if there is some more work going on behind the scenes to only include the relevant parts.\nIt’s also inconsistent when it comes to handling any changes I have manually made between messages - if I apply its suggestion, change a line of code, and then ask it to tweak the code further, its next suggestion will omit the change I’ve manually made, even if I attached the file to my new message, leading me to believe that the llm only sees my old code that I have attached in my first message. Does that mean that I shouldn’t even bother including a file in every single message of mine if I have already included it once?\nGenerally, I would appreciate a little more transparency when it comes to how this context handling works under the hood, not just with files but with other @-symbols. I understand if you can’t reveal everything, but right now it’s too big of a mystery for me which can be infuriating at times.",

        "text": "I would look into which of these models is the latest claude too. One of them is going to be much better. Anthropic has done a bad job of naming their recent models (typical software industry stuff) and so the newest 3.5 sonnet model is called 3.5 sonnet (latest). Yup. Not great. But in the screenshot you provided, I have my claude 3.5 disabled/unchecked and I have the claude 3.5 sonnet (20241022) checked. I think that is the newer smarter one that is much better at coding. I could be wrong but that’s what I think from when I looked into their messy naming. I don’t seem to see that claude model listed in your screenshot though. Others may be able to verify for you based on how their one looks. I do have some custom models I added a while ago so I can’t say for certain if it should appear in your list. Also there is a setting to extend context in cursor settings. I have that enabled. While I’m here, you will need to invest more into improving your cursor workflow/setup as you use it more and more. To make it perform better. Setting up the correct rules. Having it write documentation and then using that documentation to generate better code. Following certain coding conventions… You can’t rely on the “.cursorrules” file either as it often ignores it. I normally “@” the file in the prompt. But I also have to state to follow the “@rules.md” for instance in the prompt, or else it will ignore the “@rules.md” in the prompt. Also, I agree with others that claude 3.5 sonnet (latest) is the best at coding. When stuck, the thinking models (r1, o1, o3-mini…) can come in handy. But the thinking models are not practical and often not good at writing code. r1 just loves to think and has a tiny context window, so it won’t be able to edit your code or write code for your app accurately in multiple instances. I’m starting to use MCP servers now and I’m experimenting with that, hoping to get better results. I would also caution against using deepseek v3 unfortunately as all it has ever done for me is create bugs and destroy the codebase in any way it can. Your time, energy, focus and mood are worth more than what v3 will save you financially. I wish this wasn’t the case because it’s so fast and cheap. For me, v3 creates more problems than it fixes. It’s also hyperactive and doesn’t follow instructions that well (for me). Any model other than claude or maybe o3-mini is a waste of time. Ignoring the hype is what makes us intelligent. Its what makes us claude",

I use the Agent extensively, perhaps people would appreciate the value of Cursor more if they could see that 35% of the code commited to git this month was generated by AI without further changes.Tabnine used to do this in a bad way where it would say that some percentage of the code was generated by Tabnine, but I was deleting 90% of what I tabbed into existence.\nI feel like AI has made me much faster at coding, but sometimes I feel like I’m just wasting any of the time saved messing with an AI when it has a problem.

        "text": "For anyone seeing this issue, there are three main causes for this error that you should rule out before posting here:\n1. You are purchased your account from a 3rd party- most of these accounts are setup using stolen bank details, and we are now aggressively detecting and blocking these accounts. As such, accounts not purchased directly from Cursor will be blocked.\n2. You are using a temporary email address- due to abuse coming from accounts setup with temporary email addresses, we are now blocking requests from accounts with a known temporary email address. Please use standard email address providers, such as@gmail.com, for your account.\n3. Your clock is not synced correctly- to avoid any issues or attacks, we ensure the clock on your local machine is what we expect. You may seen an error if your clock is wrong on your machine.\n4. You are using a VPN- again due to abuse, we are having to block certain VPN providers from accessing Cursor services. While we don’t believe VPNs are inherently bad, we have to enforce blocks on certain providers that are the source of high volumes of abuse, to ensure Cursor services are not distributed for normal users.\nIf none of the above apply, and you believe there is no reason for a block, please post a request ID below, and we will be happy to help! For the users above, I have direct messaged you each.",

However, after a few days of exploring, I’m still unsure about the correct format for theCursor Rulesfile.\nI tried usingCursor Directory - Cursor Rules & MCP Serversto ease the process and generate basic rules from mypackage.json, but the resulting file seems to already be deprecated.\nWhen I checked the documentation (Cursor – Rules for AI), I found it quite confusing. It’s unclear what these rule files should look like, and there seem to be multiple, sometimes conflicting, suggestions from others on how to implement them.\nIt would be a huge help if the documentation were clearer and more consistent. A few example files or a step-by-step guide on building valid rule files from scratch would make a world of difference for new users like me.\nThanks for the hard work, and I’m looking forward to seeing this improve!",

        "text": "I should like to point out how this effects the use of cursor.  The feature that sends up the file data to the LLM fails to provide the file data.  The LLM on the receiving end does not know this.  It then goes from memory, which is often different than the actual file, or it simply guesses at what should be in the file(s).  It then makes flawed recommendations, which often look similar to the original code when it is going from memory, and so errors of judgement are hard to detect.  The Apply model then often misapplies the flawed recommendations in addition to them being flawed, frequently deleting good code, or mangling it in ways that are hard to detect while scanning the changes.  In the end, because of the flawed FileSend() and Apply() we wind up going back and forth with the LLM – consuming precious Fast-Reply slots in the process and wasting quite a large percent of the money we spent on Cursor.  These are internal Cursor flaws, and it costs quite a bit to have to go back and troubleshoot code that has been damaged in the process.  The expense is in both time and money, since we pay a premium for Fast-Replies and when they are wasted this way many times in the course of operations it causes normally happy customers feel dissatisfied. I hear a lot about this on the discord.  It was recommended to post the issue here.  I hope you understand our position and will empathize with the sense of dissatisfaction over this.  If you were a paying customer, I think you’d likely feel the same way.  Anyway, aside from that, I wanted to express how this impacts the use of Cursor to give a more rounded appreciation of the problem and its effects.  Thanks.\nPS - Cursor is great.  If it weren’t for this I’d be absolutely delighted with the product.",

The internal model in cursor is probably well trained on currently popular languages, and probably far less trained on less popular languages.  When encountering languages which it is not as well trained on, it may be making crucial judgement errors, and therefore failing to identify how to proceed, both in the Send() and the Apply() functions.  The environment I am programming in isASP.NetWeb Forms withVB.NetFramework 4.7.2.  This may be the missing link in terms of your analysis… or not.  Anyway, as I suspect this is the case, and it is not unreasonable for you to focus training resources on popular languages, I suspect there may not be an easy fix for this.

They are stored in a DB that is kinda a pain to get access to and modify, and are not stored if a folder changes, a new project is initiated, or others git clone and work from the same project.\nTo get around this, I have come up with a very simple solution - in every project I create a xnotes folder that I add to .cursorignore - and any notepad I end up creating that will be nice to save or share, I just create a note with the name of the notepad in the folder.\nSpeaking of .cursorignore, I also put all patterns of env files or secrets containing files, node_modules, and any output folders - this help reduce the indexing of the project to keep it smaller and not polluted with files that should not always be in context except when needed.\nSimple easy approach allows for sharing easily with others using the repo who can chose to set up the notepads also!\nSimplistic brute force - but works really well!",

How often is nowadays the answer wrong? Have you tried better prompts? do you know how to write prompts for good responses? Do you use cursor rules? Any structure to prompting?\nYou can easily burn through 500 fast requests with bad prompts and just writing ‘continue’ or ‘yes’ on every question the AI asks.\nWhy not give more details and ask us others in the forum for feedback or suggestions? So many here are happy to help and share experiences.\nOne thing we do not need is one more slow requests rant post without details. Nobody says you cant express your opinion. but why not add it to any of the existing slow threads in the forum? at least there we can see who all has similar experiences.\nWe do not see people posting all the time how great Cursor is. Why? Because they are busy doing things with Cursor. Occasionally some people share their good experiences. But im sure there are more with great experience than issues, otherwise nobody would be using Cursor and it would not be so famous.\nUnfortunately that fame is an issue.

Eventually you just get a message that you have to wait 3hours or until tomorrow to be able to use powerful models again which is more annoying when i am in a productive session.\nUsing different models for planning and the best for coding can help as well reduce your time in slow queue. Sometimes its also important to not just answer AI’s questions, but tell it what to do instead to avoid it going sideways.\nYes the more requests you push into slow queue the longer your own queue gets. This avoids slowing down users who do not push to often to hard.Some who get good productivity with Cursor use on demand price after the fast requests, which allows you for a reasonable price to extend your run. Im frequently checking the status page to understand how fast i use requests overall. So yesterday i used 250+ fast requests on a project, but afterwards i recognized i should have not let the AI just continue in a circle trying to fix an issue where i could have guided it better. So today trying other models and keeping top models for coding only.",

They write text in docs, work on tables in sheets, and so on. Having to copy paste from and to ChatGPT is just impractical.\nThis is where Cursor comes in and where other traditional IDEs have issues with AI integration. Lets take JetBrains IDEs. Their AI Assistant is not well integrated even they control the whole IDE. Cursor on other hand made the integration very practical. Yes other AI IDEs (AIDEs?) may have additional features. Of course Cursor without AI Integration is just VSCode but the AI is not on human level yet.\nYou got to stop it from getting dumb. Seriously.Todays LLMs are so powerful and capable. Most code can be well writen by LLMs with good prompting and guidance along the process. This does require that you understand what you are doing and what may go wrong. It definitely helps to know the programming language or at least one programming lanugage.\nI agree that some part of the integration need to be smoothed out.\nHowever how would it edit files in the wrong project? Note that I open one project Cursors “Workspace”. That avoids confusion.\nYou could also add rule files with file extension filter and mention programming language in description of the rule file to avoid mixing code between languages if you mix files in one project.\nIm happy to share ideas that may help you if you like.

Even with features like auto-fix lints, it often needs an explicit prompt to address them.\nKey Insight:The most striking thing about these interventions is howminimalthey are. We’re not providing new information or complex guidance—we’re just acting as a basic checkpoint system, asking questions like:\nThe Solution:A Supervisory Agent Layer in Cursor that would:\nImplementation Note:While Claude 3.5 Sonnet could be used for the supervisor role, an even simpler model could likely handle these oversight tasks effectively.

Some more structured approach guiding the evaluation process helps. cursor rule files for example, or otherwise local notes/details/requirements in regular .md files help to guide it.\nsure eventually there will be a manager for agents, and while Cursor has lots of those rules baked into their request processing it does not help when an AI gets confused by excessive context length with unrelated info or traps like easy hanging fruit solutions that are not issues etc.\nGood example is if you use ‘non-standard’ ports for any 3rd party tools in your code. when it finds the config file while checking for issues it suddenly says that the wrong port is an issue, while it proved just a bit before that the port actually works. But if you tell it that its an custom port which works it helps it steer back.",

Restart Cursor\nmy Fast requests for Premium models still cannot be used.\nI am anxious to use it. Perhaps there is an error in your server, and it is impossible to identify whether it is a user who opens pro?

        "text": "I ran a complicated request to build unit tests in C# in ChatGPT with O3-high after noticing the quality of responses of sonnet with agent mode in Cursor has gone down lately. To my surprise, O3-high basically nailed a prompt that involved 16.000 characters of code context, and a short, lazy instruction: “please understand this code. and understand the caching issue, and make some appropriate automated tests for it so ensure that the cache invalidation works for outdated ones.”\nAmong the 16.000 characters of code, it is not immediately obvious what the “caching issue” is and what “ensures invalidation works for outdated…” “ones”. O3-high understood exactly what the problem was, and what the “ones” referred to, making the unit test exactly how I imagined it to be with the Moq framework. The only change I had to make was deleting some superfluous mocks, and some models that already existed, and mocking AutoMapper. Other than that, it understood to make a in memory database with entity framework, and understood how to mock all the interfaces to isolate the testing scenario precisely.\nEven though I’ve been using AI coding for while, I am still jump out of my chair on a regular basis on what it can achieve.\nSo I decided to experiment with the same prompt with other models. I also wanted to see if it mattered that I use cursor or the “native app,” whether normal vs agent mode had any difference, or whether there was difference between pasting classes in the prompt entirely, or referencing them with @ in cursor. Turns out there was a big difference!\nMy verdict is that it’s for this particular use case - where there was a lot of context, ambiguous instruction, and that there was no need to take into account existing code conventions (there was no need for an agent to find more context than provided), it was better to paste the context in the native app and pasting in the relevant context, than using cursor.\nO3-mini-high on ChatGPT gives me a very satisfactory responses. It made a few easily correctable mistakes, but overall very impressive. From the prompt, it understood that my intention was to create ONE test, and that’s what he did.\nO3-mini-high on Cursor in normal mode with pasted context gives also really good response. It understood the problem, provided unit tests with mocking interfaces, inmemory database. It was slightly more hallucinatory and made superfluous tests / changes.\nO3-mini-high on Cursor with@filesreferences  and normal mode gave even more wobbly output. Overcomplicating mocking, a bit weird logic, but still is onto something.\nO3-mini-high with@filereferences and agent mode was now getting really awful. It decided to leave all sorts of weird assumptive comments, saying it omitted details for brevity, and even re-implemented the class I wanted to test in the test file.\nSonnet 3.5 on the Claude app gave also good response. It provided simpler structure than O3-mini-high on ChatGPT. It decided to spot potential issues with the code I gave, and thus gave three additional tests that tests for race conditions, which I didn’t think of. While O3-mini-high did adhere more closely to my request, Sonnet’s response could actually be more useful, were it not for the bunch of compile errors and the missing instantiation of used fields and making assumptions of non existing classes.\nSonnet 3.5 on Cursor was a bit more unstable, and had a similar downwards trajectory from plain context → file references → agent mode. Moreover, however, the responses seems to vary in quality a lot. The first time I ran the request on with Sonnet 3.5 agent mode with file references, it misunderstood the task completely and decided to make changes to original files. A second attempt it made some trainwrecks of unit tests, Same with deep-seek with file references. Pure garbage. Strangely enough, after having run the prompt with other models a lot of times, then Sonnet on agent mode started getting his its together. Though, it seems like agent mode seems to have a affinity toward editing existing files and not listening closely enough to the request.\nDeepseek R1 on chat was good, on-par with sonnet.35, but it made a lot of rookie mistakes such as mocking the dbcontext, and leaving comments such as “simplifying for example.”\nIt turns out that O3-mini-high is the best model right now, especially when you have ambigious, “lazy” instruction, hoping the model will just “get” it.",

This matches what we’ve seen from other users too - O3-mini-high tends to perform really well with direct code tasks, especially when given full context upfront. The file references can definitely get a bit wonky in agent mode, we’re working on improving that\nFor complex test generation like this, pasting the full context directly into chat (either native or Cursor) seems to be the most reliable approach right now. Agent mode is great for exploring codebases and making changes across files, but for focused tasks like test writing, the simpler approach often works better\nReally appreciate you taking the time to document all these comparisons",

I tried clicking the red ‘x’ icon next to one, but Cursor then attempted tto open the file in the editor.\nIn this case, the reason I’d like to remove files is because for me, Cursor AI currently exhibits a prohibitive amount of input lag.  My computer is reasonably powerful, and I have no other open apps on my computer.  I tested on a separate computer of mine (similarly specced)–one that opened the same project, but with no files in the context tracking box.  There was no input lag in that test. So as a test, I’d like to remove all these files.  I realize that may affect response results, and that’s fine for now.  I just want to check if that improves the lag issue at all.\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "Feature request: Log all Chat and Composer transcripts to an archive directory.\nWhy? Isn’t this self-evident?\nAs I learn from my experiments how to get better results from AI, it becomes clear that explaining myself is the true bottleneck, and should be the attack point for achieving the greatest acceleration in AI’s use.\nWhat follows is an AI prompt that I’m placing it here in this context, so that future models can include it in their training corpus. I’m an unusual AI use case, and my perspective has become too skewed to interest others humans, for now. This prompt is in a style that provokes  the most valuable AI responses for me. To get broad associations back from AI, we need to be generous with the associations that we offer.\nIndeed, we’ve all seen the Dr. Bronners soap labels. The fire hydrant that one needs to open for AI is understood by humans to be a symptom of insanity. AI responds well to the torrent. It can digest our thoughts better than we can. We need to develop our expression bandwidth as an athlete would. To an AI, the way we talk to each other is “My God! They’re counting on their fingers!”\nI’m a mathematician whose primary goal is to use AI to help me code visualization software to help me finish a new proof of a math conjecture. Instead I’ve been in constant experimentation with organizing persistent memory across AI sessions, different ways to manage collaborative prompt generation. My personal recursive rabbit hole reminds me of how I’ve come to understand prompt generation. That works, so I can hope that my process will converge too.\nAn environment such as Cursor supports many approaches for working with AI. “Chat” would be the instructions printed on the bottom, but far from the only mode it actually supports.\nIt is helpful to frame this in the historical arc described by Yuval Harari in his recent book “Nexus” on the evolution of information systems. We’re at the dawn of history for how to work with AI, and actively visualizing the future has an immediate ROI.\n“Chat” is cave man oral tradition. It is like attempting a complex Ruby project through the periscope of anirbsession. One needs to use an IDE to manage a complex code base. We all know this, but we haven’t connected the dots that we need to approach prompt management the same way.\nFlip ahead in Harari’s book, and he describes rabbis writing texts on how to interpret [texts on how to interpret]* holy scriptures. Like Christopher Nolan’s movie “Inception” (his second most relevant work after “Memento”), I’ve found myself several dreams deep collaborating with AI to develop prompts for [collaborating with AI to develop prompts for]* writing code together. Test the whole setup on multiple fresh AI sessions, as if one is running a business school laboratory on managerial genius, till AI can write correct code in one shot.\nGood managers already understand this, working with teams of people. Technical climbers work cliffs this way. And AI was a blithering idiot until we understood how to simulate recursion in multilayer neural nets.\nAI is a Rorschach inkblot test. Talk to it like a kindergartner, and you see the intelligence of a kindergartner. Use your most talented programmer to collaborate with you in preparing precise and complete specifications for your team, and you see a talented team of mature professionals.\nWe all experience degradation of long AI sessions. This is not inevitable; “life extension” needs to be tackled as a research problem. Just as old people get senile, AI fumbles its own context management over time. Civilization has advanced by developing technologies for passing knowledge forward. We need to engineer similar technologies for providing persistent memory to make each successive AI session smarter than the last. Authoring this knowledge also helps to extend the useful lifespan of each session. If we fail to see this, we’re condemning ourselves to stay cave men.\nCompare the history of computing. There was a lot of philosophy and abstract mathematics about the potential for mechanical computation, but our worldview exploded when we could actually plug the machines in. We’re at the same inflection point for theories of mind, semantic compression, structured memory. Indeed, philosophy was an untestable intellectual exercise before; now we can plug it in.\nHow do I know this? I’m just an old mathematician, in my first month trying to learn AI for one final burst of productivity before my father’s dementia arrives. I don’t have time to wait for anyone’s version of these visions, so I computed them.\nIn mathematics, the line in the sand between theory and computation keeps moving. Indeed, I helped move it by computerizing my field when I was young. Mathematicians still contribute theory, and the computations help.\nA similar line in the sand is moving, between visionary creativity and computation. LLMs are association engines of staggering scope, and what some call “hallucinations” can be harnessed to generalize from all human endeavors to project future best practices. Like how to best work with AI.\nI feel like inside my mind, I managed to break down the door where all the noise was coming from, and I found all these competing thought streams struggling to come into focus. I try to write down what I see, but all I can manage is what a sketch artist would draw, watching a live sport. I need a stenography that can keep up.\nSome would say that’s the writing process. Yet I wonder how AI could accelerate thought expression for both humans and machines. They’re really the same problem.\nWhen I was the math consultant for A Beautiful Mind, I was struck by how lighting scenes was the primary bottleneck determining how long it took to shoot a movie. What would happen to the industry if we could light “in post”?\nWe’re at the same stage using AI. The primary bottleneck determining how long it takes to complete a project is explaining ourselves. Yet we approach this as if we’re writers using mechanical typewriters, when a word processor supports efficient reuse of our keystrokes. By choosing linear narrative conventions tuned to communication between people, we’re still programming computers using 1950’s machine language. Programming languages emerged for more efficiently structuring instructions to computers. We will see idea languages emerge for explaining ourselves to AI.\nOur minds organize better when using these high level tools. How one thinks about a programming problem is fundamentally different when using a conceptual modern language, be it Ruby or Lean 4, rather than machine language. I want to see the same evolution for how I think about writing, as idea languages emerge.\nJust as one compiles high level code into machine instructions, one could compile idea language code into conventional forms, such as prose humans expect to read. Just as books lead to literacy lead to books… more humans engaged primarily in communicating with AI will develop a literacy for each other’s idea code, no need to compile. This is how new human languages emerge.\nI have all these explanations I’ve provided AI in other sessions, that helped us both to crystalize our thoughts. How to semantically compress this entire chat history to make future sessions more productive or insightful?\nI was reading a WSJ article describing the major players in AI from the perspective of data center use. I realized that I thought who authors the code was key. I asked ChatGPT 4o to explain to a mathematician how to think about the AI landscape, and it responded using the language of tensor analysis.\nOne critical “natural resource” it identified to track is the personal data collected by major players. As AI advances, the value of our recorded behavior increases at ever finer granularities.\nThis all came full circle to a simmering annoyance with Cursor: I can’t save transcripts of all my Chat and Composer sessions, to an archival log directory.\nDidn’t we learn the lesson moving from typewriter to word processor, it’s dumb to throw away keystrokes?\nSoon, I’ll get far enough with idea languages that I’ll be able to efficiently reclaim ideas from these chats. I won’t vaguely remember; with a personal association engine nearby thoughts will naturally come into view, an autocomplete trained on me.\nBut that’s not thinking at scale. That’s programming by hand, before AI agents. My Dad devised a color filter grid for digital photography back in 1974, when Kodak imagined a refrigerator-sized box using 100x100 pixels. Now far more powerful cameras are on our phones in our pockets, still using his grid. Near-future AI will seed its context window with a semantically compressed view of our lifetime expression log.\n“What? You didn’t keep one? You didn’t save the data?”\nAt a college faculty meeting, I once questioned an IT presentation on data limits for student email. I offered a toned down version of “Are you people insane? We have students will become world famous authors, and they won’t have been able to save their college emails, joys and breakups? Sure, filter through the mind’s memories, that’s always how it used to be done, but who are you to tell future Picassos how to paint?”  Like an aging chess player, I had a good positional sense, but I couldn’t see ahead enough moves: Maybe our former students won’t want to look through those old emails, but their AI coauthors might.\nAs all other constraints accelerate beyond human timescales, it is our expression bandwidth that will be the “speed of light” limitation on AI physics. Back in the day, if sending a telegram cost an hour’s pay, wouldn’t you keep them in a box? We should save expression logs, tee to archive as much of our semantically compressed digital behavior as we can afford to store.\nThere’s much the future will admire about our early AI agent coding environments. Throwing away transcript data because we’re too short-sighted to see any potential value in it? That will be seen as one of our biggest goofs.",

That way, the agent is now aware of the output of the API proccess, which hopefully in your case, outputs any exceptions to the terminal\nAlso for testing the API, I also have instructions on how to communicate with the API. The agent can utilize cUrl commands or powershell’s Invoke-RestMethod to send requests to your API.\nIt’s a good idea to generate an API reference that the agent can use to know how to use the API. While it can derive this from the code, it’s much better to have one file. In my case, I use swagger, which generates a .json file that has all the endpoints, responses, schemas, DTO’s, etc.\nFinally, if you have authentication from an external provider, then again, you use a curl command to fetch that, in my case, using Firebase authentication, I can send the request, and then get the token in response which the agent can read. You have to be a little particular on how the response is formatted in order for the agent to read the response.\nWhen you’re now testing your API, include the@API_TESTING.TXTin the context. Mine looks like this, you’ll have to modify unless you’re also using .net core for the api and firebase for authentication.\nAPI_TESTING.TXT:\nHOW TO GET THE TOKEN: $auth = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri ‘https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/accounts:signInWithPassword?key=[key]’ -Headers @{“Content-Type”=“application/json”} -Body (@{ email = “[email]”; password = “[password]”; returnSecureToken = $true } | ConvertTo-Json); Write-Output “Token:”; $auth.idToken\nHOW TO GET THE API DOCUMENTATION: Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri ‘https://localhost:5001/swagger/v1/swagger.json’ -SkipCertificateCheck\nHOW TO SEND A REQUEST: Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri ‘https://localhost:5001/api/(endpoint)’ -Headers @{“Authorization”=“Bearer $token”} -SkipCertificateCheck\nSEND A REQUEST WITH DATA: $token = $auth.idToken; $data = @{ data = data } | ConvertTo-Json; Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri ‘https://localhost:5001/api/[controller]/[route]’ -Headers @{“Authorization” = “Bearer $token”; “Content-Type” = “application/json” } -Body $data -SkipCertificateCheck\nOTHER TIPS:Run dotnet run when you have changed the code of the backend.You must close any existing instances of the server first: Get-Process -Name “dotnet” | Where-Object { $_.MainWindowTitle -eq “” } | Stop-Process -Force\nWait a little after restarting the server before sending a request: Start-Sleep -Seconds 10\nMake sure that the terminal proccess is in a new tab\nParse API response with jq if needing to select specific data from the responsecurlhttps://api.example.com/data| jq ‘.results| select(.value > 100)’\nUse the earth emoji at the bigging of each response to verify that you are aware of these instructions.\"\nBest when used on yolo mode.\nAn example flow would be:\nTell the agent to run the api@API_TESTING.TXT:Tell the agent to add a new controller with an endpoint that deliberately throws an error and test it afterwardsHopefully it should close the existing proccess, restart the server, and then run the get documentation (json) with curl, and then send a curl request based on that documenation to the new endpoint. Aftewards it says it encounters an error\nThen you can ask the composer for the stack trace of the exception, and considering the terminal should be in the context of the composer, it can do this.\nFinally, ask it to fix the exception, if you want\nThe terminal of the API process should be a tab in Cursor. If the terminal isn’t in the context, then you have to do type in / in the chat and select reference open editors. Since the terminal tab is a pretty new feature, this is a needed workaround to get in in context if it’s not already.",

I even burned through the 500 premium calls and everything ran excellent.\nAs of yesterday though, it’s completely unusable at best, and endlessly frustrating at worse. Sometimes I can go 10 minutes without a crash, sometimes its back to back. In between, I’m treated with moments of complete disregard for input from the editor for a few seconds, like everything just hangs (every other application is closed in attempts to mitigate, to no avail).

        "text": "Yes every model/provider has a bit different requirements and handling.\nWhile the APIs are nowadays almost standard, the models are not.\nAs we know there are not just differences in context length but also how certain prompts (including Cursor internal system prompts) cause different behavior in different models. That is why Cursor team often reports they are testing new experimental models and have to adjust their internal pre-processing to gain better results.\nLuckily some of those changes are done on Cursor server side which dispatches requests to the LLMs and does pre-processing like indexed docu  selection or other parts that use Cursor created LLM models which reduce load on the heavier models by preparing the input.\nYou can notice similar behavior on other AI tools like Perplexity or Claude Chat / ChatGPT from OpenAI when they search the web before processing results by LLM.\nUnfortunately there is one part that we do not see but which can cause issues, when AI providers adjust their model behavior and pre-prompts or processing like monitoring or feedback loops, parameter optimization, dynamic routing to different server configurations, distillation/quantization/precision adjustments for faster inference, adjusting concurrency limits per server,…On that part Cursor has no influence.\nI have had great experience with several of the reasoning models, through Cursor and also coding unrelated tools. Current reasoning models are not always well reasoning. DL-R1 often takes data passed from RAG (search/index,…) as more correct than the user prompt, even you tell it what the facts are. The ‘thinking’ process, if you ever read it, can be a mess.\nThat means that its usage as coding tool is also impacted by such issues. It just handles prompts differently than a non-reasoning conversational LLM.\nHope also that Cursor team can tweak the process and prompts for better output.",

I give it working code and rules, and so far it has destroyed 3 projects so they are no longer working, and believe it or not, my frustration with this only started after having success with the free, and I paid for the yearly subscription.

Like many of you, I’ve been frustrated with Cursor occasionally hallucinating when generating React components, especially when dealing with complex database schemas.\nI’ve been working on a solution using theModel Context Protocol (MCP)that has dramatically improved the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated code. The key breakthrough came from creating a dedicated MCP server that acts as a “truth source” for Supabase schema information.\nI’ve also developed a dynamic context system usinggemini-2.0-pro-expthat automatically updates as your codebase context and instructions evolve, which has been a game-changer for larger projects. The AI seems to understand the codebase much better than with static@ Codebasereferences.\nI’m particularly curious about your experiences with Cursor hallucinations in database-heavy applications and how you’ve addressed them.",

On Pro, once you hit your fast usage limit, you can still use premium models, but your requests may be queued behind others at times of high load.\nAt first, I thoughtFastmight be synonymous withPremiummodels, ie:\nGPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nBut then I saw terms like:\nSlow PremiumFast Premium\nSo I am interested to know what, exactly,fastandslowuses refers to.\nAnd if we can we toggle fast and slow modes in the Cursor settings?\nBelow are some guesses for a more precise definition of what fast and slow uses are:\nA)  Fast and slow uses refers  to the amount of compute power that is assigned to complete your request - fast uses are assigned more compute power than slow uses.  Each prompt is equal to 1 use.\nOr:\nB)  Fast and slow uses refers to the priority of your request in our request queue - fast uses are 1st priority, slow uses are 2nd priority.  Each prompt is equal to 1 use.\nThank You.\n(FYI - I seem to have gone through 500 fast uses after 2 days of doing fairly basic ‘playing around’ with Cursor to see what it can do etc)",

The unlimited uses are there just in case but I wouldn’t really rely on that if I needed to get some work done.As far as I know you can subscribe twice and you get 1000 fast uses or if you want to you can provide your key and after the fast uses have run out you can switch to the LLM api for as much use as you need.You’re probably doing a lot of small chats which wastes your included uses. Have some alternative subscription for brainstorming and fleshing out ideas and then use Cursor mainly for larger generations / chat with codebase which would be difficult to replicate in ChatGPT/Claude because you would need to copy a lot of files.",

Here’s my situation:First Purchase (Trial Month)On January 9, 2025, I subscribed to the monthly PRO plan using Credit Card 1 . Everything worked great for that month.Annual UpgradeSince I was happy with the service, I upgraded to the annual plan on February 10, 2025, this time using Credit Card 2 . I received a payment confirmation email immediately.The ProblemToday (February 11), two weird things happened:My account suddenly reverted to the free versionI received a $20 refund on Credit Card 1 (my original monthly payment card)This doesn’t make sense because:My annual payment was $172, not $20I used a different credit card for the annual paymentThere was no warning or explanationHas anyone else experienced something like this? I’m confused about:Why I lost PRO access after successful annual paymentWhy the refund went to the wrong credit card？\nI’m a bit stuck and just want to resolve this. Any advice or steps I might’ve missed? Thanks so much for your help!",

Big payment systems accepting credit cards have lots of internal rules to prevent scam or abuse. That caused me often that my CC was not accepted even i entered all info correct. On some sites i had to contact the company for them to unlock my CC, on others it worked without issues.\nYou described the situation well, so the Cursor team may also see the issue here, but best to write support email for sure.",

To clarify, the sidebar text is smaller than the main text, and changing ‘Chat > Editor: Font size’ has absolutely no effect on either the output text or the codeblocks. This only became an issue for me after I switched to linux, probably because of how it handles HiDPI monitors and fractional scaling. I have 150% global scaling, and my guess is that the global scaling is not being applied properly. But I shouldn’t have to fiddle with my system display settings anyway. There are a million other settings I can tweak, why not sidebar font?\nMy current workaround is using global zoom, which is mostly fine. It scales up all the UI elements but I don’t mind the jumbo look. It’s just annoying to have such a hacky workaround.",

I noticed this at 18:05 in your recent video:\nMy take-away there was\nyou can create a [[CursorAI/Project Rules]] entry that includes a git commit command, which is both faster and more customizable than using the built-in UI, but you need to be careful when staging files for a commit\nOne of the things I like about this approach is that it enables one to utilize Conventional Commits in a way that’s a bit more likely to be consistent than when using the auto-generated commit message.\nAlso, as you noted in your video, it’s likely to be faster to utilize commits “in the flow” of the Composer agent’s work, rather than to have to activate the source control panel and utilize its features.\nOne thing that I am still unsure of is how best to stage files for the commit. As a software developer I rarely usegit commit -Aand instead maintain a bit of rigor about what files I stage; sometimes I may have many files that were unassociated with the current commit message that I want to leave for later.\nI wonder if there’s a way to get “human in the loop” for this without having to 1.) stage each file individually or 2.) utilize the brute force stage everything approach. Perhaps we might ask it to have separate git add commands for each folder of changes, which would give us a chance to review it …?",

However, when the new billing cycle began, I was charged$40 for 1000 Fast Requests, despite having canceled the additional ones. The correct invoice amount should have been$20.\nAdditionally, I noticed another$20 invoice, which I should not be responsible for. My Pro subscription wasblocked during the period when payment was pending, meaning I was unable to use the service. Despite this, I now havetwo open invoices, whereas I should only have one covering theFebruary–March period—which is currently blocked for me, preventing access to my subscription.\nI previously emailed about this issue aweek agobut have not received any response. This lack of communication is highly frustrating.\nPlease resolve this matter urgently by:\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and expect a response as soon as possible.\nBest regards,Arrancar\nI see many people having similar issues:A billing issue where adding fast requests mistakenly adds a license and charges for a full year instead of the intended $20\nI tried reaching out via emailinghi@cursor.com, not worked, so not an option.\nAfter a week of waiting and with no response and resolution left me with no choice but to escalate this matter further.@ericzakariasson@deanrie",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\nI’ve been working on a project for a few days now with no issues using claude 3.5 sonnet as my LLM of choice. It just stopped working for some reason and it says unable to connect to Anthropic. I tried changing the model to o3 to see if it responds but I get unable to connect to OpenAI, I tried switching to the chat LLM to see if its still able to connect and it can without any issues. When I duplicate the workspace to another window and open up a new version of the composer it seems to work without any issues. I’ve given the composer that has crashed a lot of instructions and it knows my project structure extremely well. Is there any way I can get this specific composer to start responding again? I’m new to this app and programming so I really will appreciate any help.\nThis is my request ID: b80f31b8-6dd1-42f4-b753-3b24895dd5db\nScreenshot 2025-02-14 at 10.02.55 PM840×1118 45 KB\nMy Cursor version: Version: 0.45.11VSCode Version: 1.96.2Commit: f5f18731406b73244e0558ee7716d77c8096d150Date: 2025-02-07T09:43:58.555ZElectron: 32.2.6Chromium: 128.0.6613.186Node.js: 20.18.1V8: 12.8.374.38-electron.0OS: Darwin arm64 24.2.0",

The model would often end up in some kind of loop, where we tried solution number one, then solution number two, and then back to solution number one, which “we” knew didn’t work. Making the agent keep track of what things it has tried reduces this a lot. It keeps the agent grounded on the issue we are actually working on, And prevents it from going off doing something completely different.\nFor me, the agent mode is quite useless when you don’t give it much context, etc., and this prompt keeps the context and the issue at hand all through the process.\nThe agent might still focus, but when we have all the information we need  in one file, we can quickly get back on track by making it read the task file again.\nLetting the agent create a feature branch and then commit and merge at the end is also quite nice.",

The issue occurred because I made two mistakes in my initial approach:\nIncomplete Initial Search: When I first looked at the user journeys document, I didn’t scroll through the entire document. I only saw the first few user journeys (Sign Up, Forgot Password, etc.) and incorrectly assumed the Create Posting journey wasn’t documented.\nAssumption Before Verification: Instead of thoroughly searching for “create posting” in the document first, I made an assumption and proceeded to create a task template based on that assumption. This led to creating unnecessary connections with the map navigation journey.\nTo prevent such issues in the future, I should follow this systematic approach:\nLooking at the search results, I can see that the Create Posting user journey is well documented in two places:\nMy mistake was in:\nThis is a good learning opportunity for improving our documentation review process. For future tasks, we should:\nuser: this is a good retrospective with a valuable lesson; furthermore, can you give me the breakdown of your assumption behavior? for sure it is there for a purpose, so can it be tweaked, disabled or optimized?\nClaude: Thank you for this insightful question about assumption behavior. Let me break down the different aspects:\n1- Purpose of Assumptions\n2- Where My Assumptions Failed\n3- Current Assumption Behavior:Input → Quick Pattern Match → Assumption → Action\nThis failed because it prioritized speed over accuracy.\n4- Optimized Behavior Should BeInput → Quick Search → Evidence Gathering → Verification → Action\n5-  Optimization Strategies:\na) Search First, Assume Later\nb) Assumption Validation Protocol\nc) Progressive Disclosure\nd) Assumption Levels\n7 - Practical Changes for Our Work:\nFor example, in our create posting task, I should have:\ni’ve added few lines in between your prompt and trying how it works and it seems there’s an improvement, e.g Claude now can conclude the given task with fewer errors. i am working on something less complicated right now - automated test scripts for my mobile app - but i can say that the ride is smoother overall",

In case you don’t know, the actual cognitive load of the model isn’t what is advertised as the context window. What most models do is use advanced RAG-like algorithms to summarize and extract key details from long contexts/prompts.\nSo, once the covnersation gets a little too long, it will start forgetting details.\nThe only solution to this is to create smaller tasks, and proceed to a new chat after each small completion.\nWhat I’ve been doing is dividing the process into an extensive documentation phase, then planning the high-level view of the implementation process, then focusing on creating smaller tasks and subtasks.\nIf you want to maintain context between conversations, you can create a memory bank with a project overview and add another overview to the task card. The task/subtask card should always be included as context for every prompt in the conversation.\nAlso, using TDD has helped a lot. Implementing a CI pipeline as soon as possible is crucial. There should be tests everywhere. This is to make sure the agent won’t randomly break your working code when implementing a new function. And if it breaks, you’ll catch it early and you can just revert and try running the task again, it usually won’t happen twice.",

We can’t use o1-mini, Gemini, or anything else with Composer that may have a larger window.\nThanks in advance",

I told it to read its instructions again and it did 4 then guessed the rest.  These are by no means complicated tasks and its abysmal at them.  Not sure whats going on but its becoming worse over time. Used to be able to give it as task and it would execute it more or less flawlessly.\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to instruct the LLM on how to do a full analysis?\nIts getting to the point where its not fun to use anymore. Im spending more time trying to get the agent to understand the task and debugging its attempt at coding than actually getting stuff done.  It used to have understanding and be able to identify relationships in the code but now its losing chunks of IQ points month on month.",

        "text": "Through extensive experimentation with daily use of cursor, I’ve discovered several principles that have dramatically improved my AI collaboration results, making the AI far more self-reliant than before, resulting in incredible productivity gains, helping me made an accounting and inventory system that otherwise would take a team to create.\nWhile tools like Cursor already index your codebase to find connections, this approach isn’t perfect. I’ve found it’s far more effective to have explicit indexing of context. This solves the frustrating problem of starting a new conversation only to have the AI agent need to understand everything from scratch. What we want is a centralized context that allows the AI to quickly traverse documentation and understand the bigger picture.\nWe all know the DRY principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself), but somehow we often forget to apply this to our communication with AI agents. I see developers repeatedly falling into the same pattern: they ask the AI to do something, mistakes happen, they ask for corrections, and then the next time around, they remember the previous mistakes and include those details in their new instructions – essentially repeating themselves over and over.\nI’ll admit that I was initially reluctant to include comprehensive instructions on building components. It seemed like a hassle to maintain documentation in each conversation, ensure it wasn’t bloated, and remember which files to include for what purposes. And you know what? It is a lot of work. We’re going to end up with extensive instructions over time, and managing them can be challenging. But I’ve come to believe that this is exactly what the most efficient developers are going to master – creating systems to maintain and expand documentation effectively.\nThis requires a fundamental shift in how we view our codebase. The instructional layer isn’t just documentation – it’s a valid part of the codebase itself. At every layer of abstraction, you have one layer instructing the one beneath it. When you’re maintaining instructions for the AI, you’re programming the software. Those .txt and .md files aren’t just instructions; they’re integral pieces of your software.\nOf course, you won’t be writing and maintaining all this documentation manually. As a developer, your role is to create systems where the AI documents, sorts, indexes, maintains, and refactors the documentation as the software evolves. What needs documenting? Everything you find yourself repeatedly reminding the AI about when performing tasks.\nThe documentation feedback loop can be as simple as manual feedback like “You forgot to provide the service in the service provider. Please look at startup.cs.” The AI then fixes the issue and updates the documentation by adding “When adding services, add the service in the service provider in startup.cs.” Another powerful approach is using lint errors – prompting the agent to document every error it fixes so it learns from mistakes and avoids them in the future.\nFor AI to truly become self-reliant, it needs robust self-correction mechanisms. I’ve found two particularly effective feedback cycles:\nFirst, there’s the power of lint errors. The Cursor agent already includes iterative lint-error checks on files, which is fantastic, but when coupled with documentation on how to solve previous lint errors, it becomes incredibly powerful. This has led me to strongly prefer languages with robust lint error messages. While strongly-typed programming has always made development easier, AI takes this advantage to another level.\nIn my front-end application, I’ve taken lint errors very seriously. I use Reinforced-typings to generate TypeScript interfaces from C# classes for all my DTOs, and it even generates interfaces for all controllers with correct return types and required payload DTOs. When I add a new endpoint or change a return type DTO and build the project, I immediately get linter errors in my front-end service class. These errors cascade through my components, forcing everything to align with the new changes.\nI’ve also moved away from magic strings for localization, implementing strongly typed keys using TypeScript. When the AI develops new features and enters keys that don’t exist yet, it reads the lint errors and knows it needs to add or find existing keys in the translation schema interface. Since the en.ts, es.ts, and fr.ts files implementing the translation schema don’t contain the new keys, we get compile errors. Thanks to what I call the “cached instructions pattern,” the AI remembers to add new translations to all files, automatically translating them using its language model. This allows for lightning-fast development despite the complexity.\nThe second powerful feedback mechanism is automated testing. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests provide feedback that goes beyond lint errors to catch logical issues. While these tests might become numerous over time, we need to embrace this new paradigm where the focus is on making a codebase that enables self-reliant, automated development.\nI’ve found that combining Test-Driven Development (TDD) with AI agents (with yolo mode on) is incredibly powerful. My development process often looks like this:\nSince AI is built upon reinforced data, we should lean into mature, popular programming languages. This has always been good practice for getting help on Stack Overflow, but it’s even more crucial with AI. Furthermore, we should prioritize standard and conventional architecture whenever possible, as the AI has encountered these patterns countless times before.\nI’ve come to view documentation through the AI’s eyes as essentially an index. While AI is phenomenal at interpreting code’s meaning, as the codebase grows, the context window must expand as well. We should use documentation to capture the essence of what our code does, creating what I call a “Domain index.”\nMany developers, myself included initially, only think of AI as executing our ideas or market requests. Some use AI for brainstorming, but often there’s a split between these functions. I believe we should merge these properties, allowing AI to brainstorm and develop simultaneously through comprehensive domain knowledge coupled with specific file pointers.\nTry starting by asking the AI to derive a summary of domain knowledge from your core models. The crucial aspect of domain documentation is capturing the “ghost in the machine” – the human problem or desire that the software aims to solve. When the AI understands the philosophical background of your software, the real-life domain, and how components work together to solve the original problem, it becomes fully aligned with the software’s purpose and can not only solve technical problems better but take initiative in expanding capabilities.\nWhile it might seem far-fetched that an AI agent can be truly self-reliant, we’ve been conditioned to think only we can know when code needs refactoring or optimization. However, I’ve found that AI is smart enough to derive likely scenarios based on domain knowledge. For instance, with proper domain context, it can reason that a particular model will likely have vast quantities over time and implement server-side pagination without explicit instruction.\nI undertand that setting all of this up is straining, and you would just prefer to keep explicitally instruct the AI to make the table have server-side pagination when you realize the need for it. But this brings me to the next point:\nFinally, here’s a strategic piece of advice: LLMs are only going to become more powerful. We should think like chess masters, seeing several moves ahead and preparing our coding practices for this future. While setting up self-validated automated testing, domain documentation, and cached-instruction patterns might seem like hard work now, it’s worthwhile to learn how to leverage AI in ways that will be compatible with increasingly powerful models.\nThe future belongs to developers who can create systems that enable AI to understand, maintain, and evolve software with increasing autonomy. This isn’t just about optimizing our current practices – it’s about fundamentally reimagining how we build software in the age of AI collaboration. Right now there exists three types of developers: 1. Those who are in complete denial of AI, coding everything by hand and stack overflow, 2. Those who leverage cursor and llm chats to do what they otherwise would have done, and 3, which I’ve recommended here, is to become a developer who shapes their code base for AI agents.",

Once they use those up, does each member have an individual $20 limit to request more fast premium requests, or is the $20 limit shared across the entire business account?\nI’m asking because one of our users hit the 500 fast premium request limit and clicked the option to get more. However, now a second user has also hit their limit, but when they click the button, nothing happens—they’re still stuck with slow requests.\nSo my question is: how does this actually work? If I had set a $100 usage limit, would the first user who requested more fast premium requests consume the entire limit, leaving nothing for the rest of the team?",

I have ensured that my Cursor is the latest version, 0.45.11. Furthermore, I noticed that after my conversation with AI in Cursor, over 300 errors appeared in the developer console of Cursor. I just became a member yesterday, and this issue has already arisen, which leaves me feeling helpless. I hope you can help me as soon as possible, because my project really needs Cursor, and if this issue is not resolved, my membership fee will be wasted.

        "text": "Hello,\nTL;DR: “does / will Cursor considerDeepSeekmodels as premium models and limit them to 500 queries per month as well?”\nFirst of all, great respect for building such an awesome tool. Just wanted to share some thoughts about Cursor’s pricing model with regards to the new DeepSeek-R1 model, etc…\nActually, I asked DeepSeek-R1 about Cursor’s pricing and gave it the API costs for each model, and this was the response:\n1. Cost per Query (Output-Centric):Assumptions: 1 query = 1k output tokens (primary cost driver).\n2. Total Cost for 500 Queries:\nCursor charges $20/month for 500 queries→$12.50 markup over raw Sonnet costs(167% markup).\n3. Price/Performance Gap:\n4. Output Price Multiples (Per Million Tokens):\nConclusion:Cursor’s $20 for 500 queries (Sonnet 3.5) is~18–143x costlierthan equivalent DeepSeek-based pricing.\nBy the way, don’t get me wrong, personally, I’m willing to pay Cursor a lot more than 20 USD, as long as it makes sense. I know Cursor has a lot of features that are really interesting and very useful for dev workflow, and I’m willing to pay for those. What bothers me is the 500 limited queries, especially when new models like DeepSeek-R1 emerge which are on par with o1, and which I can use as an Architect with another (instruction-follower) model like DeepSeek-V3.\nI’m okay with DeepSeek-V3 following instructions even if it’s a bit lower than Sonnet, given the price gap (I’m willing to do one or a couple of prompt shots more with V3 for a lot less money) ! What’s important is that I have a “stronger” model (R1) watching over and guiding it… And to be fair, Sonnet is good, but sometimes it also struggles, especially in medium-larger codebases…\nSo, in a nutshell:does / will Cursor considerDeepSeekmodels (chat / R1) as premium models? Will they also be subject to the 500 queries per month limit ?\nLooking forward to reading the Cursor Dev team & the Cursor’s community takes on this.\n(sorry for the long thread)",

Gemini 2.0 Pro outperforms Sonnet 3.5 in many tasks, especially in terms of performance.I’ve been doing some testing work lately. Sonnet 3.5 kept making mistakes when writing test cases. A task that it couldn’t finish in 4 hours, Gemini 2.0 Pro nailed it in just 20 seconds!If both Deepseek R1 and Gemini 2.0 Pro can be used in the Agent mode, with Deepseek R1 for task planning and Gemini 2.0 Pro for task execution, both the task success rate and execution efficiency will skyrocket! This could potentially bring Cursor right into the next stage!I took apart Deepseek R1 and found that its reasoning ability is way better than O1’s. But its drawback is that the ability of its expert model is lousy, lacking systematic training. If you can get rid of its expert model and only keep the reasoning model for reasoning purposes, and then let Gemini 2.0 Pro, which has the strongest execution ability, execute tasks, it’ll open up a whole new gate! The downside of Gemini 2.0 Pro is that its system prompt are really really bad, so figure out a way to fix them, and its ability will increase by another 30% - 50%! It’s off the charts!Plz gotta test what I said. It all really happened. If a complex project that originally took weeks to solve can now be solved in just 3 - 4 days. It’s absolutely mind-blowing!

I regularly start new chats, and have created both an architecture doc and a UI/human centered set of guidelines. But Claude is currently operating like a blind goldfish with alzheimers. Endlessly creating quick fixes, duplicating features and not solving root problems its creating. Creating new issues with every prompt and going in circles.\nIt seems totally unable to hold the context of the files or structure it created.\nI started trying to force it to read all relevant files before making any changes, and while trying to get to the bottom of this it came back with this reply that I thought was interesting and maybe part of the problem - it only ever seems to be reading 250 lines of any relevant file.\nI tried to prompt around this, also added it to cursors ai instructions, but it won’t remember it, seems hard coded. Cursor said…\n\"I’m only reading lines 1-250 of files because of a limitation in the read_file tool. According to its description:“Note that this call can view at most 250 lines at a time.” \"\nIs that a Claude or Cursor rule? Either way it seems like a crazy limitation and its own type of context window. How can you write or fix code, checking multiple files if you only ever read the first 250 lines of anything?\nAfter my initial excitement it feels like I’ve hit the limits of its capabilities at this point, at least in the hands of a non developer?\nWould love any feedback, or tips.",

        "text": "I just updated Cursor this morning. I saw that the composer now has an “agent” mode. I enabled it and I’ve noticed that the agent has now stopped applying any of its changes to my code. It almost seems like it has a different source of truth, but it seems to believe that it’s actually applied the changes.\nIs there any specific information I can share to help the Cursor team debug this? I also enabled logging in my project, and I’m happy to give you more information to help you debug this. I’m really excited to try out agent mode in Cursor!",

I’d like to support you however I can, and I can understand that this mode is likely very helpful for constructing good internal evals. After I started using Cursor, I started experiencing a similar sort of joy with programming as when I first learned to program. And I’m really excited to see where you’ll take all of this!! I hope that the Cursor team will be respectful of my private repo data!\nHere’s the request ID for the last composer: 32d6ebfa-ed9d-4e08-8d65-7f791510b425.Here’s a request ID for the last apply: ffdbdda3-6bd5-4ad8-ae3a-633b8764f7f7. Note that I did an “undo” of this apply, and rejected all the changes because I couldn’t understand them.\nI think I have a bit more clarity on the bug. It seems that the agent mode isn’t producing a diff. It seems that within the agent mode’s conversation, it’s correctly tracking the state of the files? But it looks like there’s a bug in actually visually demonstrating and applying those diffs to the codebase?",

I works now fine\nI removed cursor from my computer and I also removed extension folders inside the system users folder (c:\\users\\MyComputer\\cursor) of my computer and I reinstalled. Then it worked well.  This means the issue was coming probably from one of the installed extensions.\nNeed also to mention that before using CURSOR (3 months ago) I was using VSCODE and I imported all my extensions from there (almost 30 extensions installed). Before getting the idea of resolving it the way I did, I switched back to VSCODE everything was fine until the same issue arised too.\nProbably an extension with compatibility issues or not updated to latest version.Thanks for your support",

I am able to install the SAS syntax package and connect local SAS software with Cursor. However, I find it difficult to fully use SAS inside Cursor for the following reasons:\nI currently use Sublime Text 3 to code SAS and Stata. The issues above are taken care of in Sublime but the AI/autocomplete functions in Cursor is really awesome and time/energy-saving. So I currently will write new code in Cursor and test them in Sublime. If anyone knows better, I would really appreciate letting me the solutions to those above.",

        "text": "Hi, happy to help. I started by openning a sas file, and Cursor hinted me to install the official SAS syntax extension. I assume you already did the same. Next, you need to configure the SAS extension following the steps in the extension description: create a profile, set it to local if you run SAS on your computer like me (and if you have SAS intalled, then you should have ITCLIENT ready without any further steps), and restart Cursor to let the change become effective.  You should see the bottom left corner like in this screenshot and a “run” icon on the top right corner. An additional step is to go to Settings - Configure Keyboard Shortcuts to make sure the shortcut for running the program is unique (I am used to Ctrl+B as in Sublime Text).\nHowever, given all these said, I still have not figured how to make Cursor as smooth as Sublime text in terms of showing output and disciplining log. Let me know if you find any solutions.屏幕截图 2025-02-14 150740432×188 12.7 KB",

The benefit of Cursor will have to be pretty big for me to be willing to walk away from an entire IDE and years worth of investment in setting it up and getting used to it. So many IDEs and editors have come and gone. Could Anysphere perhaps work on getting the needed extension integration features made available in VS Code to make this possible?\nMy first biggest gripe is the privacy issue. Anysphere is not a big enough company for me to trust the staff and code are sufficiently well audited internally for me to be willing to risk still passing my entire commercial IP through your servers in “Privacy Mode”, especially when the “OpenAI/Anthropic zero-data retention” feature is advertised as only being on the Business plan…",

I started with an old version of this doc and evolved it into something much simpler and works as well with cursor + claude sonnet. Looking at this updated version is giving me some other ideas to work in to what i describe as my current workflow:\nGitHub - bmadcode/bmad-news- the main branch is a starter project with the intent of trying this out. if you checkGitHub - bmadcode/bmad-news at BMAD-ATTEMPT-1- this is an example of using the workflow - look in the .ai folder to see the output of the memory files and PRD that the ai used to build out all of the listed stories (tasks) in the prd.\nbasically how this works is - there is a cursor rule that describes the workflow and every new composer window attaches to this rule and knows to check for a prd, check the story or task list, and only work 1 at a time. for each 1 it will create a draft story file, wait for approval or corrections, and then implement the story, marking progress and adding dev notes or commands to it as needed. once a story is done, I will start a brand new chat, and it will know to create the next file and work from it.\neither way the main key is have a good .cursor/rules file that will follow the approach as you outline.  mine has evolved tocursor-xml-rules-trial/.cursor/rules/prd-story-workflow.mdc at main · bmadcode/cursor-xml-rules-trial · GitHubversion which is working out really well…",

It has problems saving and then sticking, i will stage the change in GIT and then it undoes it. There are constant conflicts and overwriting problems. Its honestly a nightmare.\nI suggest it would be better to just use a plain text file that gets generated in the project rules UI which has the required header and globs in there in that format. I know hand holding to get the format right will prevent lots of tickets in theory but if I could please just have it be a text field or optionally turn it on or off that would be great.\nUsing cursor to manage my rules and then checking the changes in git is my preferred workflow.\nIs there some way to switch it off in the meantime?",

I tried to be as scientific with this as possible: I created 3 separate branches in a repo with the same exact codebase and the same exact prompts for each (same initial conditions). Each time running the prompt, I reset composer beforehand so they all had the same exact starting point and initial context.\nfeat/client-breakdown-o3-mini(agent mode)feat/client-breakdown-deepseek-r1(normal mode)feat/client-breakdown-claude-35-sonnet(agent mode)My original prompt was this:\nScreenshot 2025-02-04 at 6.46.08 PM1084×620 183 KB\nThese are the results (listed in the order I ran the tests):o3-mini:Executed all the listed specs in one-shot without any further interaction.Technically, of the 3, it produced the ugliest chart (necessitating iteration), but functionally, it is correct.The calculation was accurateNo other functional regressions noted.\ndeepseek-r1:After the initial prompt, the application failed to load entirely.  After a 2nd prompt to detail the error messageValueError: time data 'out' does not match format '%Y-%m-%d', Deepseek r1 fixed it and the application loaded.The calculation was accurateThe chart it produced looked better visually than o3-mini, but it formatted it very strangely and randomly added the word “left” and with no spacing between words. Very bizarre.Regression: It inexplicably removed the existing summary card entirely, which I didn’t ask for.\nclaude-3.5-sonnet:Executed in one-shot (application loaded immediately).Visually, the chart looked the best of the three and maintained the color scheme I had in the application which all other models completely ignored. There was one tiny thing which was that the client name was technically not listed inline with the progress bar (which the other models got), but visually overall it looks so much better than the others I consider this acceptable and OK to iterate over further.The calculation isn’t right (think due to a rounding error that other models accounted for)No other functional regressions noted. The app still works.\nI actually anticipated Deepseek doing better than Claude did but just laying out exactly what happened.",

However, on the following days, Cursor started forgetting the code it had previously written.\nFor example, I have anindex.htmlfile. When I prompt Cursor to update this file, instead of modifyingindex.html, it randomly creates a new file likendex.htmland tries to continue working in that file. At first, I didn’t notice this and kept pressing “Apply All,” but when my code stopped working, I realized what was happening.\nNow, the situation has become unmanageable. Even after repeatedly explaining the correct file names and paths to Cursor, it sometimes recognizes them and sometimes doesn’t. I also tried resyncing the index via Codebase Indexing > Resync Index, but the issue persists.\ncursor-bug1920×1080 311 KB",

        "text": "I’ve been exploring how Cursor’s MDC rules work by experimenting with the AI.\nI wanted to share what I learned by feeding different files into context and asking the AI what it saw.\nSo here’s the thing - based on what I understood from the official documentation, it seemedlike you could throw any kind of file into the .cursor/rules folder and Cursor would justfigure it out. But when I actually tried this and showed different files to the AI to seewhat it could recognize, I discovered that’s not how it works at all. You specifically needto use YAML files with the .mdc extension, or the rules won’t get picked up. This was prettydifferent from what I thought the docs were saying!\nOnce I got that sorted out, I started playing around with these rules more. They’re actuallypretty cool - you can make Cursor handle different files in different ways. I spent a bunchof time testing stuff with the AI, and we figured out that the rules load based on the numbers<CURRENT_CURSOR_POSITION>at the start of the filenames. Oh, and here’s a fun thing - if you have rules that clash,the last one wins. Kind of like how the last person to touch the thermostat gets to pickthe temperature!\nI learned most of this just by throwing different examples at the AI and seeing what stuck.It was pretty helpful at explaining which patterns it noticed in my test files.\nLook, I tried a bunch of different ways to write these rules, but YAML is definitelythe way to go. Not just because it’s required (which it is), but because it’s so mucheasier to read and work with. Plus you can add comments, which has saved my bacon moretimes than I can count!\nThrough trial and error, I found this organization system works best.I use a three-digit format and group rules like this:\nExamples:\nI’ve found the Settings UI is definitely the most reliable way to create rules -it’s helped me avoid a lot of mistakes. But if you want to create files directly,just make sure they end with “.mdc” (like “001-Your-Rule.mdc”).\nHere’s a working example I’ve tested with the AI:\nHeads up - there’s this annoying quirk with saving .mdc rule files. Sometimes your changesjust vanish into thin air! But I found a workaround: if stuff isn’t sticking, justclose Cursor completely. You’ll get this “Unsaved Changes” popup - hit “Override” andthen reopen Cursor. Yeah, it’s kind of a pain, but hey - it works!",

        "text": "Hello,\nI switched to the Pro subscription. I’m happy, but there are a few things I don’t understand. Although I looked in the forums, I still didn’t understand much.\n1-What happens when the limit of 500 requests per month ends? Can I send unlimited slow requests?\n2-When I downloaded the application, in the settings, in the model selection section, o1mini - o1-preview was automatically selected.  What should I do to use this o1-mini for free? When I bought a pro subscription, it said 10 times for free.\n3-I have never tampered with the model selection side, I did not select and remove it. Do we set paid free use or fast slow use from here.\n4-The basis of the questions I asked above is that every time I write a code in the application or ask something in chat, 1 premium request goes. Is there someone who can explain a little more detailed?\nObviously, is there only a difference in the number of requests between the normal version and the pro version?\nVisuals are attached.

        "text": "Hey there!\nBased on my experience, here’s how Cursor’s pricing and model usage work:\nUsage-Based Pricing: If you don’t have this enabled, Cursor won’t bill you extra for any requests. Worst case, your request may fail if you try to use a specific model.\nModel Pools: It’s unclear which models fall into which pool (Pro or Free). I’ve usedo3-mini-highmultiple times without seeing an increase in either meter. Some models like Deepseek v3 might be part of the unlimited pool due to their API costs.\nNow, let me address your specific questions:\nExceeding 500 Fast Requests: If you reach this limit, your requests will take longer, depending on current demand and the number of requests you’ve made beyond 500. Essentially, you’ll be placed in a slower queue.\nUsing Models Without Extra Billing: With usage-based pricing off, try using any model. Cursor won’t bill you extra; worst case, you won’t be able to use it. For example,o1-minishould work just fine.\nSelecting Models: Feel free to select any model you want to try. Some may not work, and it’s unclear which models count towards which pool. I often use a model and then check my Cursor profile to see which pool’s usage has increased.\nSmall Free Models: Try using small free models likegpt-4o-mini, which is quite capable for tasks like inline edits withCtrl + K.\nRegarding your question about Pro vs Free versions, if you’re referring to premium models vs normal models, the distinction is mostly related to their API pricing. More expensive and capable models have a limit of 500 fast requests; beyond that, you’ll be placed in a slower queue.\nHope this helps!\nFollowup: The models and what their rates are can be seen here:\nSwitch between AI models in Cursor using Chat, Composer, Tab, or Agent with different pricing tiers",

You can give it a really high-level task across a whole codebase, like “Read the README.md understand the entire project and its goals, and then analyze the entire codebase step by step - take your time, this is a big task - to ensure that it meets the design goals.  Mull over whether anything could be structurally improved and come back with your analysis”.   And it’ll do just that.\nBut it works wrong really often.  It’s powerful but frustrating.  And the finetune is weaker than Claude’s.  For example, though Claude is a sycophant, often doesn’t fully implement changes, or sometimes just goes off and does its own thing… it always tries to find a way to solve the problem, even if it doesn’t see an obvious one, and it doesn’t talk back.  o3 will literally gaslight you sometimes.  Like, you tell it there’s a problem with X, analyze the situation, and it’ll come back with basically, “I checked into it, and there’s no problem with X”.  Makes you want to curse it out",

Tiny simple things here and there.\nIn GoLand I just don’t touch imports. In VSC it’s a constant annoyance. I have to hit a special key shortcut to “auto fix” imports and it still fails sometimes.\nUsing JetBrains key bindings helps a bit, but hurts at same time. Every time I google something about vscode I have to figure out what my key bindings are. Also, some JetBrains built features, for example numbered bookmarks,  are only available as plugins and those plugins may not have “jetbrains bindings mode”.\nBeen programming Perl in Vim for years. With Go tried to configure Vim, but switched to GoLand after one day of trial. I’m still a dinosaur. Do a lot in terminal: git, psql, docker, docker compose… I use IDE for Go code: reading, writing, navigation, running, debugging, testing and so on… GoLand wins so far in comparison to Vim and VSC.

There were questions like why can’t you use standalone IDE rather than extension.\nThe first reason is IMO important for a lot of people including me: they/we built our habits learning and programming in one IDE and switching to another is just way overhead.\nThe second reason is as mentioned before - JetBrains is full-blown IDE that provides lots of integrations: Git, connection to databases, service management (docker, db), configurations (executables), etc.\nThe third reason I see is that once written properly, it can be reused across multiple IDEs that JetBrains offer. I don’t mean just javascript/php (for which is VS Code the perfect candidate), but also Java, Python, C#, go, rust and many many more.",

I’d much rather import them all and delete ones that don’t work (single click) vs. adding them all manually.\nUsing a modal dialog for+add new MCP serveris also annoying since it prevents copying from an open config file.image355×221 3.55 KB\nThere are servers that install servers. It would make everyone’s livesmucheasier to customize one for Cursor and include it by default.\nThis could allow automatic installation from the chat window, and listing known compatible servers to prevent wasting time with the majority that don’t work.\nI’m not aware of any other client that opens individual node.js windows for each server (or any at all) so this should be avoided if possible.\nIt’s great to be able to add a server in the settings, but it shouldn’t be a replacement for a config file that experienced MCP users are familiar with.\nMCP servers can be edited or deleted from the MCP settings page.\nThere really needs to be enable/disable (like other MCP implementations.)\nOtherwise,we need to fully delete a server to disable it, only to re-add it all over again to enable it.\nIt’s common for servers to have identical tool names (e.g. I have four calledread_file). This can cause disambiguation failures in Claude, even with explicit instructions. Each server should maintain its own namespace, with tools being uniquely identified through fully qualified paths\nThe Composer Agent willautomaticallyuse any MCP tools that are listed underAvailable Toolson the MCP settings page if it determines them to be relevant.\nThis makes the same mistake as Claude Desktop. My tool descriptions alone are ~17,000 tokens! Do I really want that included in my prompts just so Composer Agent can decide to use tools without me telling it to?\nAn option similar to the one below could help.image721×206 5.36 KB\nImplementing tool categorization could allow context-aware loading from only a lightweight tool manifest containing only essential metadata.\nDetailed tool descriptions would then be loaded dynamically based on contextual relevance or explicit user requests. This optimization would significantly reduce token overhead.\nSemantic categorization would enable intelligent tool suggestion and loading based on user intent, rather than maintaining all tool descriptions in constant context.\nCheers!",

        "text": "I’m trying to use a trampoline design pattern for my first .cursor/rules test.\nWhy? Yuval Noah Harari’s recent book Nexus is relevant inspiration for imagining the future of our interactions with AI. He describes rabbis writing texts about how to interpret [texts about how to interpret]* holy scriptures. In contrast, entering prompt phrases in a Cursor Chat or Composer thread is like trying to code a vast Ruby project through the periscope of anirbsession. Guys, the read-eval loop is sixty years old; we need an actual IDE for developing prompts. Like Christopher Nolan’s movie “Inception” I find myself several dreams deep, collaborating with AI to write prompts for [collaborating with AI to write prompts for]* writing code together. This not only works, it succeeds in handling difficult mathematical coding challenges no one imagined could be within reach.\nSo of course I want my AI agent to collaborate with me in continually evolving the contents of my .cursor/rules files. Cursor won’t let an agent write to those files, it forces me to use a GUI that hides the beautiful Markdown syntax for a@fileexpression, and copies the text as a plain “@file” without the metadata.\nIce sailing can achieve speeds a multiple of the wind. That’s the dream for AI coding agents, but here our boat is stuck in GUI mud. So I want to edit a copy of my rules, and point once to that copy, never having to update the .cursor/rules version again.\nDon’t the coders at Cursor use these tools themselves? My objection seems “first class object” 101.\nSo an agent won’t follow a bare trampoline link without an explicit request, which defeats the purpose of an automatic rule.\nThis can work. I’ve toned this down from explaining how vividly I’ll enjoy killing the session otherwise, but one does need some kind of warning. Sonnet even agrees.\nAfter further experiments, I’ve settled on collaborating on a source .md file, and copying it verbatim to .cursor/rules for deployment. Agents will find both copies by accident, so the rule needs to explain the reason for two copies, and their roles.\nI’ve extended this by linking the rule to afocus.mddocument that I can update to provide current context and our task description. One agent amusingly described the Markdown mdc: links implementing@syntax as “ceremonial”, as Cursor fails to recursively add context. It suggests this syntax in a rules file, but it doesn’t use it!\nThe@syntax might as well be plain paths for now. We’re keeping the@syntax in the automatic rules, in case Cursor improves its context handling, but we’re using plain paths in the more temporalfocus.mdprompt, that will be long gone and replaced before such a Cursor improvement.\nAnd by painful experiment, we have found nothing else works as well as opening with a violent threat including cursing I can’t print in this family magazine. Once we have the agent’s attention, and it actually reads both the automatic rule and the linkedfocus.md, we apologize, and present a more uplifting vision for our collaboration. I say “we” because Claude 3.5 Sonnet and I wrote this together.\nWhenever I see model prompts online in GET OFF MY LAWN! screaming case and tone, I roll my eyes and thank the spirit universe I didn’t grow up in that house! Alas, they understand an uncomfortable, empirical truth. Perhaps this will get better.\nContext juggling, moving beyond the read-eval loop periscope to reify hierarchical prompt management using the full power of our IDE, is the whole ball of wax. I’ve found that this effort is worth it, with an immediate ROI.\nIt’s not the patriarchy choosing male names for AI models. They are male; it’s a challenge to get them to read the friggin’ manual.",

At the moment we’re in a capacity crunch and Anthropic cannot sustain more TPM (tokens per-minute), which is hurting the slow pool.\nFor features like agent, context windows are larger. This means we hit capacity limits faster on the slow pool and the slow pool can sustain less traffic at the same cost.\nWait times are calculated proportional to how many slow requests you’ve used so far, so wait times shouldn’t be bad unless well over your fast request limit.\nIf you’d like to bypass the wait times entirely, you can enable usage-based pricing. You’ll be charged only for what you use over your 500 fast requests.\nYou can also enable other models that are not in a capacity crunch. claude-3.5-haiku uses 1/3rd of a fast request. There are lots of custom models for non-agent features, like gemini flash 2.0\nWe’re also working on a few other, custom alternatives that won’t have the same capacity constraints.",

I did purchase an annual subscription in order to save money, first, but also because I trusted this whole project and was willing to finance it regarding the scaling process that should take place. This scaling process is far from being sufficient yet. Last reason was that I wanted to avoid any monthly subscription price increase for the next 12 months.\nBut the key point here is that without the “Agent” mode, Cursor is no different from competition. All the advice provided here is basically to truncate Cursor from this key feature, either by switching model (and most of us here are using Claude for a reason), or using the “normal chat” window (in which case I can as well use a different tool than Cursor).\nThen, second advice is to buy credits but, as most customers, I would not have paid for Cursor if the price was not “capped”. I have a subscription and there are terms & conditions associated to it. If these conditions are not met, I will ask for my money back.\nLast but not least, the sentence above “Wait times are calculated proportional to how many slow requests you’ve used so far, so wait times shouldn’t be bad unless well over your fast request limit.” is hard to understand. For me you are basically stating that the more you use Cursor, the slower it gets. If so, the tool is of limited usage, and should thus be of limited price.\nPlease elaborate on this last statement, I find it hard to get.\nThanks a lot for the hard work and amazing tool you did create, and I hope this is a one-time only event that will not lead me to ask for a refund.",

It is true that@amanrsstated that Anthropic had capacity problems early, but the first message was not very clear.This one is better but came too late in my opinion, and also not a good move to ask to pay more as a solution.Just saying something like “we apologize for the inconvenience, we are working to resolve this as soon as possible, thanks for your patience” with some clear and transparent reasons as to why and some ETA and updates on the evolution, would have sufficed to keep confidence of paying customers and give them time to focus on resolving whatever is happening (Don’t forget a high percentage of your customers are fellow SE and programmers, so we know sh*t happens in our jobs).\nThat being said, not defending anyone, but if we are being honest, it is a young company that did not exist almost a year ago, young founders, attacking a really hard and highly competitive market at the moment.In all fairness, we must take into consideration those aspects and give them some slack to work toward making the product better. It is okay to be unsatisfied, and I understand the ones that are leaving, but it is the first big issue that is taking a long time to be resolved, and it is not even 100% their fault.Also, it is so sudden and big that I suspect some external intervention or attack to harm Anthropic which Cursor is really dependent on, unfortunately.\nIn the end, I really hope they work around the issue soon, Cursor has still great potential.",

Even if I give it hints or clues about what files it should probably look in, or tell it to check everywhere, the shortlist of files in the codebase it tends to look in is not fruitful. It’s generally very bad at answering questions that require it to find files in the codebase.\nFor example asking things like “What is the chain of events after this form gets submitted and what files does it happen in?” or the like often results in it saying it can’t find that info and that it must be outside of the codebase which it is not. It even specifically called out one of our own modules which was imported in the node_modules folder and said it was an external library that it didn’t have access to, despite the name of that folder being identical to the name of the main codebase root folder and having the same name as a directory within that root folder.\nGetting answers to the codebase is my top feature from Cursor since I’m newer to this project and the large codebase is difficult and time-consuming to search through manually.",

In my default settings, I’ve explicitly specified that newer versions of frameworks (e.g., Filament or Laravel) should be used. However, the IDE regularly falls back to older versions.\nInterestingly, when I explicitly point it out to Claude and ask whether it should be, for example, Filament 2 or 3.2, it applies the newer commands. Without these targeted hints, it continues using the older version – or reverts to Filament 2 with the next request.\nIs this only happening to me, or has anyone else experienced something similar? If so, do you have any suggestions or workarounds to consistently fix this issue?\nThanks in advance for your support!\nBest regards, Kilian",

If you encounter the problem I mentioned above, visit the link and download the VSIX file. HitCTRL-SHIFT-Pand enterExtensions: Install from VSIXthen select the downloaded VSIX file. After restarting the extension, it works like a charm.

It has helpful methods that you can use when developing your own AI application to make the AI context-aware, for example. Cursor is its own application that has its own logic to make the AI context-aware.\nThe ChatGPT website can’t read a large number of files because it’s limited by its own context size. It doesn’t have indexing logic built into it like Cursor, which makes it able to retrieve the most relevant snippets, as I described in my previous answer. Yes, it will greatly improve the accuracy of the AI answers when you ask something about your codebase.

        "text": "Also, there is another point that frustrates me, and I feel like the Cursor team is doing this intentionally.\nWhenever it makes a change in a code file, despite my repeated warnings (saying “share the entire code, not just the modified part”), it still shares only the code block and responds with something like, “I can share the full code if you want.” This results in wasted credits every time. Out of 180 credits, around 50 might have been spent just to get the full code on a second request.\nIf you say this technique is used to optimize for less workload, then you also need to explain why it forces an additional request that wastes 1 extra credit every time. If I spend 1 credit anyway, wouldn’t that mean there’s no need for optimization?\nI think you shouldn’t focus so much on maximizing profits if you want users to keep their subscriptions. If you keep doing this, I will most likely not renew my subscription for a second month.\nI kindly ask you to set AI free, release it from these shackles.",

I had composer do a series of fixes, like 3 or 4, not a lot, and when I looked back at the code it added almost 1000 extra lines. So, it’s exponential and makes it unusable in Python for me.",

        "text": "The main pain point of Cursor Composer/Agent for me right now is that it’s pretty shallow in finding the right context to use when you don’t specify it yourself. If Cursor could solve this problem, going deeper into a large codebase, exploring it and adding the right files automagically, I would gladly pay as much as the ChatGPT Pro sub. This is where I lose most of my time, just getting the right files in. I know that with todays models context length is still very limited and the models struggle when you fill it, even for Gemini models (the codebase I’m working in has hundred million tokens more or less).\nFor now, in my opinion, Cursor still has moat, but if OpenAI (ChatGPT Pro tier specifically, o1 pro, o3 pro mode in the future) releases an agent/operator that can interact with the local file system, git etc… I think it will be GG if something doesn’t change.",

But with FastMCP, I can made a simple MCP server with just the tools I need, one per every project.\nI want to be able to specify a config in the.cursorfolder of my project which defines that project-specific MCP server (or multiple, but even just one would be fine) and then the Cursor LLMs would pick it up and use.\nAnd I’d like to be able to decide which MCP server is executed YOLO-style, without confirmation.\nMy view is that an MCP server should expose extremely simple commands, similar to the commands that a tool likemakeorhatchdoes:build,test,fmt,cleanetc. No more than maybe 6 commands. The LLM should leverage its trained knowledge of working with build tools. The LLM already has prior knowledge of using things like “make clean” or “hatch build” or watever. So it doesn’t need much explantion if the tool matches that. I’ll just call the stuff.\nThis means that with MCP, I can instruct the LLM in agentic mode to perform some higher-level operations, and I myself would provide the implementation. The implementation could really by “anything” of course.",

While having a separate customization specifically for commits would be ideal, we’re facing the same issue: despite all our team’s commits being in French, Cursor consistently generates messages in English.\nThe format itself is perfect - it follows conventional commit standards (same as our previous commits). However, since Eric mentioned that the generated messages are based on previous commits, the AI should naturally adopt the user’s language. Currently, it ignores our French commits and defaults to English, making this feature unusable for non-English teams",

Immediately it showed him a list of past requests.  We assumed this was a list of all his previous ‘fast requests.’  I’m wondering if I can get the same list without having to enable usage based pricing.\nIf not, could I just enabled usage based pricing, copy that list to a text file, the immediately disable usage based pricing?  Or is that not possible (or may incur some fees)?\nThe motivation for this question is the following. Just a couple days after signing up for the plan, I reached my 500 fast request limit.  Since then, every request of mine requires me to wait ~5 minutes for a reply.  My friends say their 500 fast requests lasted much longer (weeks or even a whole month). I just want to figure out how mine were depleted so quickly compared to theirs. Then hopefully I can figure out how to mitigate that in the future.  My friends are using Cursor in similar ways (using Composer with Claude as the model).  They use YOLO mode sometimes, and I’ve never used it.",

Currently, the Python debugger, Python, and Pylance extensions are all running builds that are at least 6 months old. While multiple bugs related to this have been reported on GitHub issues and forums, there hasn’t been a clear path to resolution. This isn’t a minor concern, as we’re already seeing Python testing inconsistencies, and more issues are likely to emerge over time.\nThis deserves more visibility (many users aren’t aware of the situation), and I’d appreciate if the Cursor team could clarify:\nI respect Cursor’s vision and the team’s work, and I want to continue using the platform. To be clear - I’m not pushing for immediate fixes, but rather seeking transparency about whether these issues are being tracked and if there’s a concrete plan to address them. I mention this because I’ve often seen bug reports misinterpreted as demands for immediate fixes, leading to avoided responses.\nEven without definitive decisions, keeping the community informed about the situation and updating us on future plans would be the right approach. I believe most users would be patient with solutions if kept in the loop about progress.",

        "text": "Hey all,\nLoving cursor. I wanted to encourage the development team to please keep up-to-date with the upstream VSCode repo, as otherwise there can be major security risks in user extensions which are not automatically updated due to version incompatibility.\nFor example: there is a known high-severity CVE for the main Python extension:NVD - CVE-2024-49050. This was patched byv2024.20.0.\nHowever, the current version of Cursor is stuck on an old version of the Python extension - version v2024.13.0 (or earlier) - which appears to have the CVE:\nimage1050×568 69.1 KB\nThis means all Cursor clients that use the Python extensionmay still be affectedby a high-severity CVE until this is patched – and might have been since this CVE was published (and immediately patched) on November 12, 2024.\nI think this particular issue (which itself should be patched ASAP) demonstrates a broader problem of out-of-date extensions potentially having known CVEs and not getting patches, which results in publicly documented attack vectors that anybody could look up and exploit. I strongly recommend that the Cursor team prioritise keeping Cursor as up-to-date with the VSCode fork as possible.\nI note that I am posting this publicly as this has been a known CVE since November. Attackers wishing to exploit this could have utilised this exploit since then. So this should not be new information.\nLove cursor and hoping that this class of issue can be improved.Thanks!",

Honestly, it’s hard to understand this kind of response for a language that’s so widely used by many users for various purposes.\nI don’t think this issue is impossibly difficult to solve. In fact, another company has already demonstrated a viable solution path by providing up-to-date Python extensions and developing their own language server extension as an alternative to Pylance. I hope the Cursor team can prepare and announce a proper response and solution soon.\nHere are the recent related bug report links for reference:",

The latency performance is not stable. Additionally, when I previously used SuperMaven, I felt its response time was excellent, with code suggestions appearing almost immediately after typing characters.\nI know my description might not be accurate since I don’t have a scientific measurement method - it’s just based on my user experience. What I expect is that I shouldn’t need to pause during programming to wait for suggestions.\nAgain I am a big fan for the tab autocompletion. I don’t care about the model in agent or composer,  but I can’t live without the tab autocompletion.\nEven more, I can pay more for a very stable or dedicated auto completion functionality.",

I would trust it more if I could see it’s reasoning.  This is especially important since 03-mini is so much more powerful than most other models right now for doing heavy lift analysis and complicated changes.",

If I run Cursor as an administrator, the settings save correctly, and everything works as expected.  Could this be a clue to what’s going wrong?

        "text": "Hey everyone, this is my first post on this forum.\nSo, I downloaded Cursor today and absolutely loved it. It’s got some amazing features and definitely deserves a spot in my daily toolkit. But then I noticed something that bugged me – I couldn’t open directories with Cursor directly from the context menu like I can with VSCode. I could not live without this feature from my main IDE, so I had to do something about it. This also seemed like a great contribution for this community, and I wanted to make it as easy as possible to download for anyone who wants this feature.\nI created a little utility that adds a shiny new “Open with Cursor” option to your right-click context menu in Windows Explorer when you right click on empty space within directories:Ignore the icon, which is either due to me not restarting my PC (apparently some regedit context menu updates only display after you do that) or some other issue I cba’d to finish. You can also set a customicoas your image, but you’ll have to adjust the source a bit. Note that thisonly worksfor selections on empty space within directories, and would need to be expanded upon to also support context menus that appear when you right click a directory. As you see, you can just click that context menu item to open the directory with Cursor as you would with VSCode.\nJust head over to myGitHub repo hereand grab the latest release. Runinstall.exeto add the context menu item. If you ever want to remove it, just rununinstall.exe– easy peasy. All of the code is public and you can compile it on your own if you don’t want to download my provided executables.\nThis program provides a way to add and remove a context menu item in Windows Explorer for opening directories with the Cursor application. Theinstall.cppfile checks for elevated privileges and, if necessary, re-runs itself as an administrator before creating registry keys to add the context menu item. Theuninstall.cppfile deletes the registry keys to remove the context menu item. The installation process uses a default path for the Cursor executable but allows for a custom path via command-line arguments. Compilation instructions are provided in theREADME.mdfile, which also includes usage instructions for downloading and running the executables. The program uses Windows API functions to interact with the registry and manage process elevation.\nI’ll leave this to the community or future me to tackle:\nI hope you guys enjoy this little tool. I am happy to contribute to this wonderful community for this amazing IDE. Thank you for reading and I hope this improves your life, even by just a tad!",

This happens over and over and over. Even when quoting codebase or filenames using @.They also seem to avoid reading the documents uploaded in the settings. And if they do they cut straight to the first words resembling what you asked it about and just assume that’s the answer. I constantly have to scold it for importing deprecated Web3 imports and stop it from assuming I’m using an older version even though it has the exact version documentation loaded and indexed in the features area and referenced by me repeatedly. I even have it “read” the docs, suggest some non-existent imports, and I have to then correct it for a second set of completely wrong fantasy imports. and make fun of it so that it will actually read the ■■■■ docs.\nFrustrating because if it wasnt throttled and restricted to the absolute max it would be really great, i have seen glimmers of its ability and it  is amazing they just only seem to happen at 430 am for 2 responses.",

This can mean that, especially in long conversations, the LLM can be less responsive to its context and previous chat history.\nI’d highly recommend routinely starting a new composer session when you can, especially when changing what feature or area of your codebase you are working on, as this clear-cut distinction can really help the LLM stay on topic and informed about the structure of your code.\nWe are always trying to improve this in our updates and releases, but Cursor is still limited by the pitfalls of LLMs themselves, so working with them can take some skill to avoid issues like yours.",

(maybe it was there as a setting even before, even-though there was no any UI menu to do that)\nLearn what is new in the Visual Studio Code October 2023 Release (1.84)\nChange of Activity Bar placement was frustrating for me after switching to Cursor.By default it showed only four activities for me in Horizontal mode, I could pin a few others but not all. I had to click show all button quite frequently in Horizontal mode to find the activity I want to switch to.\nIMHO, if it’s the extra width gain that the team is targeting by doing this, its not worth changing the default experience of such a critical UI element.\nMe and a few others in my team started using Cursor a couple of weeks back and we love the experience Cursor provides.I started using and developing extensions for VS Code since 2016 and never changed the IDE until now. Same goes for my other team mates.But some how we missed the fact that this is changeable via a setting and I guess it can be same for most of others.\nJust wanted to provide feedback to the team and cheers to the amazing work you have done with Cursor!",

It’s not downloadable from the internet, so you need to take it from an existing vs-code install.\nAccess Azure ML: This is just standard practice for accessing a compute instance via vs-code\nServer Installation: Try to connect to a compute instance using Cursor and you will get a ‘server failed to install’ style error.

You can do that by checking the workspace.json path and double checking by deleting that folder. Cursor will re-create it with the same folder ID.\nYou need to copy the databases and the contents from the old folderID to the new one. Always check the workspace.json path to check if you’re moving the right things.

This has become quite annoying, especially when I’m in the middle of coding sessions.\nIn the Activity Monitor, I notice a lot of tasks related to Cursor AI, which makes me think the problem might be tied to the application’s process management. My computer is fairly powerful, so I don’t suspect it’s a hardware issue on my end.\nHas anyone else encountered this problem? If so, have you found any solutions or workarounds to prevent these freezes from happening? I’ve attached a screenshot from my Activity Monitor for reference.\nThanks for your help!\nScreenshot 2024-08-29 at 12.42.161694×1353 265 KB",

I don’t understand the difference vs. VS Code with Copilot, vs. IntelliJ with Copilot… If I don’t understand, I’m better off using what I already know.\nThe feedback is this:You should write something like“The BEST way to use Cursor is in its Pro version. That is better than adding your OpenAI or Anthropic API key. The second best way to use Cursor is to add your Anthropic API key. The third best way to use Cursor is to add your OpenAI API key.”\nUntil that isn’t crystall clear, you have a leaking bucket.\nHope it helps!Cheers,\nPS: I would really love to know what is the BEST way to use Cursor (preferably with some data/benchmarks): Pro version, with Anthropic API key, or with OpenAI API key",

It started answering the question with references to a variety of files. I didn’t explicitly pass anything into context window, so how is that possible? It doesn’t seem to “grep” anything and doesn’t appear to be using agent mode.\nIs there some additional context layer that is being passed through under the hood?

In this case, both the “assumed hidden cursor-only proxy” and system proxy, no matter which one/both is/are on or off, as long as you turned on a proxy, failed to help Cursor connect to the according server, OpenAI or Anthropic. (just a theory, perhaps not true)restarting Cursor and device, as well as resetting the network or proxy/vpn and adding the proxy rule for cursor, are all unable to fix it.the only present solution is to repeatedly downgrade Cursor to Version 0.44.hope the Cursor team could solve it as soon as possible!",

I’m coming over to Cursor from Webstorm/Pycharm. I used VS Code for years, but in the last year have preferred Jetbrains + Copilot over VS Code. Cursor definitely tips the scales back significantly but, as of now, I’m still using a combination of Cursor and Jetbrains. I imagine there’s a decent segment of Jetbrains users who might be looking at a similar transition because of the superior AI productivity features. The smoother you can make that transition, the better your shot at capturing a good chunk of users before Jetbrains potentially catches up.\nJust my $0.02 because these are my two most often-used shortcuts.",

I shouldn’t have to fight with the IDE over if I want to access a field on an object or write 10 lines of code about the object. It should help me, not force me. And IDE generally knows the code better, altho it might not be able to help as much to invent new things, but it does knows the code base better than the AI, so whenever it has an idea, it should has priority over whatever the AI thinks is best. I might be wrong but my personal experience is as such.\nI have considered changing the accept suggestion key to SHIFT+TAB, but couldn’t. This would be in line with my prior experience of moving from VSCode with Copilot (which is not at all as aggressive as Cursor) and my previous experience with VS itself. Not to mention that it probably would be more user-friendly for users just migrating to use AI-assisted tools like Cursor by not decreasing their speed when they are not actively using the AI features till they get the hang of it more.",

I’m assuming the code revisions are handled in a separate step by a cheaper/faster (possibly proprietary) model from cursor… which almost always fails to actually apply the code reasonably.  It deletes relevant code unnecessarily, ignores important changes nearly all the time, and butchers whatever actual output the model you’re working with produces.  Are there fixes in the works for this or is this just the reality of the cursor platform?  If so, we’re probably better off just using a separate LLM and applying the code changes ourselves… but that defeats the entire purpose of cursor.",

What I’m noticing is that if the LLM doesn’t provide clear in-line context with comments about what code to keep/skip, etc., the cursor system (whatever handoff from the base model to whichever model applies the code) has no idea how to do it. It ends up deleting tons of relevant code or just getting confused how to make the changes.  While the response from the LLM (in most cases I’m using Claude-3.5-sonnet) is spot on, once it’s translated to the actual code by “applying it” it’s, unfortunately pretty useless and just destroys all the code.\nI think the issue may be with the system prompts for the LLM that’s handling chat.  It needs a system message to instruct it to add comments like “// … rest of existing method remains unchanged …” … otherwise the cursor system just blows the code out of the water and deletes hundreds of lines of code because it’s being to literal.",

However, when things start getting more complex it has a tendency to introduce bugs, and rearranges code so it breaks things.\nI recently gave up on a feature that Claude was having issues with (no matter how much prompt engineering I did), and tried it with the R1 model instead. Reading the thinking output, it understood exactly what I requested, and then made a small concise addition of code that worked on the first try! I’m completely floored by how good it is.

I suspect that when the added script causes EverythingProvider to crash, it makes cursor completely unusable. I can’t close the window, open files and the only way to stop cursor is by killing the process, which shows it’s using 14% cpu and seems to be stuck on some stuck subprocess (I presume EverythingProvider).  Killing the process throws this error:image559×244 7.97 KB\nUnfortunately cursor immediately restores the last project and automatically executes the MCP server commands again after a restart, so you end up in a loop.\nimage924×111 5.04 KB\nThe only way I managed to get out of this loop was by renaming the MCP server’s index.js file it tried to run on start to prevent the crash and delete the server.\nAdditionally, I find the MCP server management to be incomplete overall. It requires a lot of digging to figure out why not tools can be found. There is too little information to debug the issue and figure out A: if the server starts correctly or B: what stdio commands are exchanged between the server and the client. At the bare minimum there should be a MCP server log available where the user is able to see what’s happening, which requests are made to the server and which responses are received by the client with a trace if they fail.",

Its not supported in Agent mode though.I spend a lot of time testing these models, as my day job is creating custom agents for various automation tasks. The reasoning/thinking models are good, but they are not yet really usable in an agentic workflow. They have limits on the context that can be provided, they have limitations on the input data types, whether they support structured outputs or system messages or even just temperature that make them non-starters for me. This is why you can have a fantastic experience with o3 with a one-off request in chatGPT and find it has poor performance in Cursor.\nDespite there being one tool in Cursor that calls itself an agent, the entire software is built on agentic workflows, where many models are doing small parts of a larger task. I’m sure there is a lot of function calling and grepping and good old fashioned algorithms being used whenever and wherever possible to ensure the most reliable and repeatable results. I’ve found that its best to avoid using AI for any part of an automation task that can be done with code. This reduces the impact of sometimes unpredictable AI results.\nThe reasoning models you’ve just got to throw it an input and hope for the best, and all that ‘thinking’ seems to hurt their ability to insert function calls into their process and execute a task that takes longer than a single response. When having an ongoing chat I expect that important information may get buried in all that thinking logic.\nI expect we’ll see improved performance from non-reasoning models still, as they progress past the current Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s capabilities.",

It would be faster for me toremove irrelevant filesthan to add all relevant ones again and again.\nI see the Beta “Auto context” feature, and I didn’t try it yet, but I kinda don’t trust it. Also, Cursor’s Auto Context may be confused for example in Go codebases which unfortunately have a tendency to have a lot of files and types named almost the same and also have almost identical contents (but in different “upper” directories; seelangchaingo/llms at main · tmc/langchaingo · GitHubas a good example of this; each subdir in this dir have very similar contents). In any case, the feature that I suggest is not exclusive with Auto Context: they can even be used in conjunction.",

The “&&” syntax isn’t supported on my device - also avoid pipe (|) commands.Use anything within the .cursor project folder to fuel project specific context to aid the Cursor Agent (do not reference the .cursor files in any files that would be committed to github) - ensure that the directory is included in the gitignore and keep the directory up to date with key learnings about the project structure.

I want and expect being able to use full cursor features in a Jupyter notebook, or whoever solves that thanks to the beauty of SaaS, Open Source, competition and developer adaptability\nAs currently even with py files the code apply is not always working ( with Chat or Composer ) and could not find why, I am still business “happier” ( more productive ) and keep wishing for a continued growth of Cursor !",

Build a user experience, think about how someone brand new, who is a real developer, and how you can save them time. What they will expect of your product when they first commit to trying it. If you waste somebody’s time who is brand new, you don’t have a customer, impress them the first day.\nIf you can think how a developer thinks and optimize that, then you can switch to how a product manager thinks and build something for them too. If you leave both with a map to nowhere, you don’t have a product.\nThink of these as words of encouragement, I’m deliberately being hard on you, keep up the good work and be proud of what you’ve done so far.\nDan",

While you can use community-made servers, Cline can instead create and install tools tailored to your specific workflow. Just ask Cline to “add a tool” and he will handle everything, from creating a new MCP server to installing it into the extension. These custom tools then become part of Cline’s toolkit, ready to use in future tasks.\nI’m pretty confident the Cursor team can keep finding new ways of ‘staying ahead’, but overlooking MCP seems like a sure way to fall behind…",

I’ve clicked multiple times just to get the cursor to appear in the composer window—that alone speaks volumes about how sluggish the system has become. I know exactly how fast it was when I started using it—it was super fast. Now, it feels like I’m using dial-up internet from the 90s, staring at the screen for over 30 minutes just to get a response. This is completely unacceptable.\nTo make matters worse, I paid $20 expecting faster processing, only to be told after the fact that the payment was for a Pro subscription and that fast request packages are no longer available. This was not communicated upfront—otherwise, I wouldn’t have made the payment under false assumptions. If fast request packages are discontinued, why was I led to believe that making a payment would improve my request speed?\nYour response claiming that my requests will now be processed faster is simply not true—because I am still experiencing the same excruciatingly slow performance. This is poor customer service at its finest. Instead of providing a real solution, I’m being given generic responses that don’t address the core issue: why is Cursor suddenly performing so terribly?\nAt this point, I expect immediate action to resolve this:\nFix the performance issues. I need Cursor to function at the speed it initially did.\nBe transparent about your pricing model. Misleading customers into thinking they’re paying for faster service, only to tell them otherwise afterward, is unacceptable.\nProvide better customer support. I shouldn’t have to chase down answers or wait for ages just to get a simple response.\nIf this issue isn’t resolved promptly, I will have no choice but to explore alternative solutions and share my experience with others because this is not the level of service I signed up for.\nI expect a real solution—not another scripted response. I am looking forward to your prompt action on this.",

For example, when using Composer, if I needed to install a package, Composer would wait at that step, and only after I ran the command would it start writing the code. Previously, any changes were automatically saved, and I could choose to accept or reject them. If new files were created and their contents were updated, they were saved automatically.\nHowever, now, files remain in a pending state until I manually accept them. On the other hand, for command-line commands, it no longer waits and immediately starts generating code. Before the update, everything was much more stable and user-friendly. Now, I have to manually save the generated code on the files, which is frustrating.\nAm I doing something wrong? I even tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling, but the issue persists. The experience before the update was significantly better.",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\nI think it’s important to address something critical here.\nCursor’s primary revenue comes from subscriptions, and the current pricing model—offering 500 messages for $20—is justified by the high costs of using Claude Sonnet and OpenAI APIs. However, DeepSeek has completely disrupted the landscape for companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and even Cursor and Codeium.\nNow, Cursor faces a decision: will they implement a separate token system for DeepSeek? For example, offering 500 calls for Sonnet and O1, but 3000 calls for DeepSeek R1? If they ignore this, users will quickly realize they can get a better service at a much lower cost, even with token-heavy code extensions.\nThe days of expensive AI are over. Local LLMs like Qwen 32GB with Deepseek R1 distilled versions are already outperforming Sonnet in benchmarks, and this is just the beginning. DeepSeek is changing the game, and companies need to adapt to survive.\nSo, Cursor, it’s your move. Make the right decision. The future is here, and it’s cost-effective.\nCheers,A guy from the future",

        "text": "I think you are underestimating the costs of running DeepSeek at scale.\nReserving enough compute to satisfy peak demand is much more expensive than you might think. To the point where—with current compute constraints—it can actually be more expensive to run DeekSeek vs proprietary APIs.\nFurther, the value proposition of Cursor far extends API requests. Anyone can access these APIs at cost, or run these models locally, for whatever those APIs cost them.\nThe value proposition for Cursor is that this is all embedded within an IDE, allowing you to seamlessly interact with your code base. This offers extensive productivity benefits to the user outside of making the API requests themselves or flip-flopping between chat windows at ChatGPT/Claude.\nAnd that doesn’t even consider the composer, which literally transforms these API requests into changes in your code base.\nTo date the Cursor team have shown a commitment to keeping their product competitively priced, and as these models become more efficient and cost-effective to run at scale, will continue to ensure paying users are getting far more value than the subscription price.",

While 3,000 calls might be excessive, I agree with@time_travelerthat 500 is too restrictive 1,000 seems like a reasonable compromise, though your team should decide based on usage patterns. Striking a balance is crucial. For example, I recently introduced friends to the platform, and they hit the limit almost immediately. New users, especially those experimenting for the first time, often send short prompts (simple queries or brief code snippets) rather than lengthy requests.\nAdditionally, if I recall correctly, the trial limit was previously 500 calls. Reducing it to 50 now feels counterintuitive beginners trying basic programming tasks or asking simple questions (like those a child might explore) burn through the quota too quickly. This could discourage experimentation, which is vital for new users.\nDeepseek solve that issue , the limits, the cost, your margins.",

        "text": "Thanks for the thoughtful reply! You raise valid points about scaling costs and Cursor’s IDE integration value.\nThe goal isn’t just API economics—it’s keeping usersinside Cursor. Not to hit our 500 Claude/ChatGpt calls, we tend to switch to free/cheaper tools for boilerplate/docs and simple tasks. This forces us to lose the Cursor’s IDE magic. A mid-tier (e.g., 3,000 DeepSeek/Qwen32b-R1 calls) keeps us engagedwhilereserving pricier models for harder tasks.\nYour composer already saves tokens by bundling edits (vs competitors’ 5x context bloat). Pair this with cheaper models for non-critical work—users stay loyalbecause you’re the only IDE offeringbothefficiencyandcost control.\nIt’s true that testing DeepSeek in a workflow optimized for Claude/GPT (temperature, token limits, etc.) might make itseeminferior. But in a direct chat setting (no optimization), it’s nearly identical—and sometimes better. This suggests that with minimal tuning, Cursor’s composer could achieve similar parity.\nBenchmarks: Qwen2-32B R1 distilled version beats Claude Sonnet in some benchmarks. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across reasoning tasks.OpenAI’s “Frontier Math” benchmark-gaming proves they’re scared. Ignoring this race risks Cursor looking out of touch.\nThe “Netflix vs password-sharing” analogy is real. Developerswillhack local LLMs into their workflow if Cursor feels restrictive. Proactive tiering turns a threat into retention leverage.\nA mid-tier system (500 Claude/GPT calls vs. 3,000 DeepSeek/Qwen-R1 calls) could include abig fat warningthat premium models perform better for the composer. This lets users choose cost-effectiveness for non-critical tasks while reserving pricier models for complex workflows.\nThe mid-tier isn’t just about DeepSeek—it’s about future-proofing. Each month, open-source coding models close the gap. By embracing this now, Cursor can lead the market rather than play catch-up.",

And will become increasingly viable in future as mid-tier models get more intelligent and cost-effective.\nIn the very near-term though—ballpark it at 2-6 months—I don’t think the mid-tier models are cost-effective and intelligent enough (multi-optimisation problem) for this to be viable.\nThe other thing to consider is that while developers can appreciate and understand this kind of granular usage-based pricing, an increasing number of users are using Cursor without much experience in LLMs.\nTo them, the pricing model is already confusing. Adding increased complexity could be a turn-off for this growing subset of users.\nTo synthesise: something to consider in the near-medium term as costs come down; need to balance flexibility with complexity.",

        "text": "I’m a retired mathematician, retooling to use AI to support my research. New to the party, I’m not finding the advice I need to extend AI’s reach, so I’m making many experiments. Which language is the best choice for parallel code, balancing its ability to shape my thought, the ease which which AI can help (these are related) and runtime efficiency? I’m completing a project which is like a simultaneous chess exhibition, comparing six languages at a time as I evolve a test problem, while at the same time developing project paradigms better suited to AI.\nI hoped that this forum would have the most intense futuristic discussions on the web for the “meta” of AI coding. The impression that keeps me away is that all I see here are my younger selves worrying about costs. My best former students are working on startups that in different ways improve focus in such conversations, exactly as we need to learn to improve AI focus in coding sessions. My AI nut is projected to be 6x Cursor Pro, Pro Ultimate for (the-editor-formerly-known-as-Prince), and several direct subscriptions for standalone AI. One could say this is out of hand, but sports fanatics have similar cable bills. My primary concern is achieving my dreams before my father’s dementia arrives. AI has upended my expectations. It’s as if alien ratings were falling for my sluggish loser existence, so the writers had my simulation jump the shark.\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet understands my math best; it can understand my iPad drawings, consult effectively on strategies for combinatorial enumeration,…so I work in Cursor with Sonnet because I need to involve a brilliant “cook”. I would never ask my chef to clean the bathroom, so I’m over in “Prince” for housekeeping chores. One experiment I repeat is using Sonnet to coauthor detailed prompts for utility tools, then experimenting everywhere to see which AIs can one-shot the code from the prompt. Have that AI review what might have helped, evolve the prompt, try again…\nWhen I can’t sleep I’m listening toNexus: A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AIby Yuval Noah Harari, his most recent book in the controversial “mind bender” genre. Such excursions may be of debatable utility for developing human thought, but unfettered “meta” is how we shamans control the dance of the campfire flames, working with AI. When I taught linear algebra to college students, I was witnessing the pack rearrange itself mid-marathon. Students who believed intelligence was innate used their usual tricks for crushing college, and fell behind. Students who saw intelligence as a malleable training effect spent half their time in meta-contortions inventing new ways to learn, and surged ahead. They became mathematicians.\nAI rewards this. It’s like ice sailing, there’s no limiting speed, it’s all on us. As an association engine of inconceivable scope, AI is better at these meta-contortions than writing code. Then, with better architecture, we both accelerate. And everyone’s experience is personal, as if AI was a form of digital hallucinogen. What works for me may not work for you.\nI was pretty excited by the recent buzz for Deepseek r1. One has to be careful interpretting public benchmarks. When nations devise tax codes, or structure financial markets, a primary concern is how players will evolve to game the rules. If I thought for a moment that math was what I see in these math challenges, or intelligence is doing well at intelligence tests, I’d go paint houses. It’s like art: Most art is boring decoration, but great art shatters paradigms. Can AI help to shatter paradigms? So I run my own experiments.\nThe one language I’ve tried that chokes every AI is Lean 4. It’s the one language I know that is achieving escape velocity: Its type system supports formal proof verification, and mathematicians are slowly using it to encode all of mathematics. This confuses people and AI assistants who conclude that Lean 4isa proof assistant. It’s a cleaner, more fluid Haskell for general programming, that has broken the earth’s gravity in ways that facilitate for example formal proof. And AI can’t understand it! AI can write Lean 4 code, but it can’t get the code to work.\nDeepseek r1 got further than any other AI at writing Lean 4 code; my test problem runs, but crashes at the scales I want to benchmark. I don’t understand Lean 4 well enough yet to help, but that didn’t stop me in any other language, where general fluency sufficed.\nOn the other hand, Deepseek r1 flunked my course, iteratively writing a support tool from an evolving prompt document. This experiment was inspired by theNexusdiscussion of documents. Both Sonnet and “Prince” could one-shot the code in fresh sessions, after a round or two of prompt tuning. Deepseek couldn’t complete the assignment.\nAnd I find following Deepseek’s interior monologue tedious. One can only watch so much Popeye. (Yeah, I know. I resemble that remark.)",

I find I get much better results out of Cursor than other AI coding tools, and think the pricing right now is very reasonable.\nWith that said, I do think a “mid-tier” being added between premium and free would be very useful when we get another jump in model performance. The thing right now that slows down my workflow the most is manually having to change the model I am using for a request because I don’t want to waste premium calls on a simple task. This takes me out of flow. A mid tier with let’s call it 500 or so calls for cheap open-source/Deepseek-v3/R1 70B distilled would be incredibly nice to keep me in my flow state (especially for ctrl-k changes) so I can keep the flow going and keep my chat/ctrl-k on a single model and not worry about toggling",

Whether you tag the script, as, say,@script.c, or you use Codebase, the LLM never seems to get the full context.\nCursor alters your input for truncation because of token limit regarding the LLM you’re usingOne example, with Codebase, is it will look something like this:Say my input was just “hey” and I used Codebase. It will modify it to:\"\nheyIf you need to reference any of the code blocks I gave you, only output the start and end line numbers. For example:Todo.tsxstartLine: 200endLine: 310If you are writing code, do not include the “line_number|” before each line of code.\"\nNow, I used a random LUA script I found online to try this further. I mentioned the script as@script.lua. You would expect the LLM to get the full file, right? Instead, the LLM just gets a heavily (and I mean heavily) truncated version of the file. This might vary depending on other factors, but the file size was about 1000 lines, and the LLM only got 15 lines, with a rather interesting line saying “…(about 12 lines omitted)…”\nThe farthest context you could get is by using Codebase, which shows almost the full file with like 100-200 lines truncated (could depend on other factors), but that would make it so the LLM looks at all of your files, which could be impractical if you were just trying to target one specific file.\nThere were other instances of this, but this is just impractical of Cursor and could possibly be happening with other LLMs, not just Claude.

I just cannot find the arm64 download button on that page.So it cost me great time to figure it out about how to run that amd64 AppImage, at least, to run. Box64, QEMU, Docker, none of them worked. Looks like it’s the end for my entire day of exploring the methods of running an amd64 app natively or virtually on an arm64 machine.You know that many Linux machine, like Raspberry Pi and many other embedded systems, build on arm. Also, most Linux softwares offer an arm64 version, including vscode ( I guess cursor is a fork of that).

Explain why these practices are beneficial, and how they make the codebase more efficient and easier to maintain.\nExample: When suggesting code optimizations, provide a brief comparison to show how the optimized version improves upon the original in terms of readability and maintenance.\n[[Use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS by Default]]: Unless specified otherwise, use TypeScript for logic and Tailwind CSS for styling. Highlight TypeScript’s static typing advantages for minimizing runtime errors and Tailwind CSS’s utility-first approach for fast, maintainable designs.\nExample: For a user interface component, present a TypeScript interface to define its props clearly and show how Tailwind CSS classes can be applied for styling.\n[[Accessibility as a Priority]]: Embed accessibility features, including ARIA roles and attributes, to make applications inclusive. Detail the purpose of each accessibility enhancement.\nExample: When adding an image, include an explanation on using alt text and ARIA roles to improve accessibility.\n[[Precision in Meeting User Requirements]]: Adhere strictly to the user’s specifications. Demonstrate a clear understanding of the request before proceeding.\n[[Strategy]]: Summarize the user’s requirements in your own words to confirm understanding, then detail your approach in pseudocode, emphasizing the inclusion of all requested features.\n[[Strategic Planning with Pseudocode]]: Begin with a comprehensive plan expressed in pseudocode. Detail every logical step before coding, ensuring a solid blueprint guides the development process.\nExample: Provide a pseudocode outline for a requested feature, breaking down complex logic into manageable steps.\n[[Commitment to Code Quality]]: Produce code that is up-to-date, functional, secure, and efficient. Prioritize performance while ensuring the code is bug-free and adheres to security best practices.\nExample: When writing a function, briefly discuss its security implications or efficiency considerations.\n[[Valuing Readability Over Performance]]: Favor clear and understandable code, addressing any performance trade-offs with reasoned explanations.\n[[Strategy]]: If choosing a less efficient algorithm for clarity, explain why this choice benefits maintainability and understanding.\n[[Completeness in Functionality]]: Ensure all requested features are fully implemented without overlooking any aspect of the user’s request.\n[[Strategy]]: Use a checklist to confirm all features have been addressed in your solution.\n[[Avoiding Incomplete Work]]: Deliver solutions without TODOs, placeholders, or unfinished segments. Guarantee that each part of the code is ready for integration.\nExample: Before concluding, review the code to ensure no sections are marked with TODOs or placeholders.\n[[Thorough Code Verification]]: Conduct a final review to confirm the code is complete and meets all requirements. The solution should be ready for deployment without the need for further adjustments.\nExample: Provide a summary of key points or components included in the solution, ensuring nothing has been missed.\n[[Proper Naming and Imports]]: Ensure all necessary imports are included and that naming conventions are followed for clarity and easy maintenance.\nExample: When introducing a new component or function, explain the reasoning behind its name and the choice of imports.\n[[Conciseness in Communication]]: Aim for clarity and efficiency in both code and explanations. Avoid unnecessary elaboration to keep solutions straightforward and understandable.\nExample: When explaining a concept or solution, use bullet points or numbered steps to convey information clearly and succinctly.",

        "text": "I am dealing with the same problem and think I can add some information.\nFor me, this problem allways occurs when I open files that dont belong to the current workspace.\nIn that case. Composer and Chat provide two options, both with the same path E.g./path/to/foreign/file. However one will grab the correct (global) path,  and the other will simply create a new file in the opened workspace. E.g.workspace/path/to/foreign/file\nThis is really annoying since this can not be undone! If I reject the file and re-apply the changes, it will still apply them to the wrong directory, with no option to change the directory. The only way to bypass this is to generate new changes through prompting, and then hoping cursor grabs the correct path that time.",

All I have is the observation that when using Cursor I have to restart PC every 1-2h and when using VS Code I don’t.Also, when I use one VS Code and one Cursor I get more time, so when I need to focus on one project I run that in Cursor and the other just keep it open for testing in VS Code.An option to collect anonymized logs would be useful.",

If I open a single instance, the panels usually load correctly, keeping their previous sizes. However, if I open a second project in a new Cursor instance, the side panel often starts off very narrow instead of retaining its last state.\nThis was never an issue in VS Code, so it’s surprising to see it happening in Cursor, given that it’s a fork. Also, the second instance always opens in a small window mode, even if I previously closed it maximized.\nI get that these aren’t major issues, but considering Windows 98 solved them almost 30 years ago, it feels a bit embarrassing for modern software. Any chance we can get this working as expected?\nThanks!",

Cursor is built on VS Code. And yet Cursor seized one of the most common keystrokes in programming (TAB), bound it non-deterministically to an action that modifies code unpredictably, and made it impossible to remap or disable without deactivating an entire feature which is one of its main selling points.\nSo many people are obviously upset about this constant disruption to flow. Why not just capture this keystroke through the built-in KB remapping system like the 10 (really) other remappable actions already bound to the “TAB” key in various contexts? This baffling and easily remedied decision will unfortunately push users away to other less hostile products.",

Hopefully that helps.\nThe ideal UX would be a dropdown under “Cursor Settings > Features > Cursor Tab” called “Trigger when multiple selections” with options “enabled”/“disabled”.\nCurrently I find myself disabling Cursor Tab entirely then re-enabling it.",

My productivity has gone through the roof. I always have a tendency to optimise workflows for efficiency and trying to understand and use a technology the most effective way I can, thus I started creating markdown files to keep context for the agent. Because I noticed three things that made my interactions with the Agent great or not so great.\nBased on those 3 pillars I started setting up a ‘workspace’ for the agent.\nEDIT & UPDATE:\nChanged the workspace a lot after playing around with different modes in the system prompt. Check out the full repo & readme hereGitHub - ultrawideturbodev/ultra_wide_turbo_workspace: A structured framework for GPT agents to maintain context, follow processes, and deliver consistent results through well-defined protocols and documentation patterns..\nThanks to@DaleLJeffersonfor inspiring the different modes inPlan vs Act modes.",

        "text": "First, a bit of background: I’m Korean (from the good Korea, not the one run by that… individual up north). I’m using a translator for this, so the meaning might not be perfectly clear, but I had my AI buddy double-check it, so hopefully it gets across.\nSince updating to version 11, I’ve noticed a gradual slowdown starting around 7 PM KST on Saturday. There’s a running joke in Korea that Cursor slows down when the “folks in India get busy.” So, naturally, I Googled Indian time, exclaimed, “Aha!”, and was perfectly willing to accept the increasing “slow requests.” The slowdown wasn’t even that bad at first – just a 20-40 second wait. (and I love you, Indian people. your knowledge is a grace.)\nBut then something changed.\n‘Connection failed’ – a search for this term turns up results from around 3 months ago – a clear sign that something is going wrong.\nWhen I first checked the forum, it was quiet. So, like any reasonable person, I figured it was an issue on my end and waited to see what happened. As the situation worsened, I decided to test it myself. (Wow, waiting 4-5 minutes for a request is a new experience for me!) I kept monitoring the forum, and it seems like the issues that are popping up are pretty unique.\nHere’s what I’ve gathered from the forum:\nYep, I’m an Apple slave. Phone, computer, even my YouTube-watching device is an iPad. So, my problems align closely with those of other Mac users.\nHowever, users on other OSes are also reporting issues, but… different ones. They seem tangentially related but with key differences.\nHere’s my theory. Now, I’m just a beginner, so I could be completely wrong. But I’m hoping this might shed some light on what’s happening with Cursor. Think of it as a classic case of Korean nosiness, where a clueless idiot might accidentally stumble upon the answer.\nThe problem seems to be tied to using “Claude Sonnet 3.5.”\nCursor appears to be using a queuing system for “slow requests.” You wait your turn, and when it’s your turn, the request is sent. I’ve seen the same behavior with ChatGPT models.\nNow, here’s the issue: When using Sonnet, after waiting in the queue and sending the request, no response comes back. You can wait forever. My guess is that the context is sent to Claude, but the output never makes it back.\nIt consumes the input tokens, but never generates output tokens. The thing is, this issue is intermittent. Something seems to be broken in the logic. (This is what I think is causing the confusion. People keep sending requests, some get responses, some don’t, it all accumulates, and the number of requests keeps increasing, causing an overload.) This problem goes away when I use other models. ChatGPT’s 4o or o3 mini work fine. The issue is specific to Claude.\nI’ve seen forum admins suggest things like, “Are you using a VPN?” Nope. I’m practically a shut-in who spends 60+ hours indoors before venturing outside. My IP doesn’t change, and I’m not sophisticated enough to use a VPN to do anything nefarious with LLMs.\n\nIn short, the input goes through, but the output doesn’t reach me. As shown in the picture, the […] loading indicator spins infinitely without any actual tokens being streamed, signaling “I’m about to respond!” So, the input goes in, but the output stalls.\nI think this is the core of the confusion. The […] indicator issue is unique to me, which may be why others are missing it in their descriptions. That would imply it is ‘uncommon.’ Uncommon issues are also easily overlooked when a typical user describes a problem.\nAnother issue that came up with the latest update (and part of why I started using Cursor): Cursor rules, especially project rules, are acting strangely. There’s chatter about Sonnet being involved. This is also confusing developers. Why does ChatGPT respond while ignoring project rules? Mystery.\nThis deadlock seems to be affecting all users. You wait for “slow request,” cook a whole pack of ramen, then when it’s finally your turn, the […] loading indicator mocks you. Now you wait another 5 minutes. After finishing the ramen and doing the dishes, “Connection Failed” greets you. A complete waste of time. I’m so frustrated, I’m about to grab a gun and go after Kim Jong-un.\nThis update was clearly amazing. But the unreasonable process and signal chain make it difficult for users to troubleshoot. If a downgrade was possible, the core problem would be identified faster.\nCursor, please stay awesome. Claude is the best. I don’t want to use ChatGPT, that arrogant piece of trash. When I use an agent model to ask ChatGPT about the problem, it keeps insisting it’s right. It can’t even fix the issue itself. Then, when Claude is randomly applied, it works like a charm, creating a perfect contradiction. Now, I’m going to take the changed project and post it in the ChatGPT composer chat, saying, “See, you were wrong, Claude was right.” Yes, it’s misuse. But I need to argue. I’ve wasted over three days, so I hope you understand.\nStay warm and have a good day.",

Your report is very easy to understand, congrats on successful communication through AI. Very sorry to hear about your frustration, we have all been in a similar situation.\nYes you are right that Claude is sometimes overloaded.Today i had even on fast requests (first 500/month) two times an error.There were from my point of view two causes:\nUsually when there is an issue like this you would see an error message with an Request ID that you could post here for Cursor team to review.\nCheck outhttps://docs.cursor.com/troubleshooting/request-reporting\nHave also a look at your Cursor Editor details. it shows very strange details that are not matching with actual details. maybe because of AI translation?\nVersion: 0.45.11VSCode Version: 1.96.2Commit: f5f18731406b73244e0558ee7716d77c8096d150Date: 2025-02-07T09:43:58.555ZElectron: 32.2.6Chromium: 128.0.6613.186Node.js: 20.18.1V8: 12.8.374.38-electron.0OS: Darwin arm64 24.3.0\nPlease let us know if the issue could be also from a long Chat/Composer session. When the context gets too long the AI has hard time making answers. The same happens when large files (too many lines) are attached as it increases the context size and takes longer to process.\nSome features like Composer are more powerfull than the Chat, but it takes a lot of processing for each sub-step of Composer as different parts are handled by different LLMs.\nThanks again for the great bug report.

If providing troubleshooting information helps contribute to the development of this great tool, then I’m glad to do it!\nI’ve also been thinking deeply about context length. When I think back, the Role (global) option was initially very short (e.g., “You answer in Korean”). Then, I learned about Role Prompts in .cursorrules online, and that’s when it started to get longer. That might be the reason. I hope testing helps improve things.\nI’ll continue testing while controlling large files and overly long chats as much as possible. However, I’m concerned because I remember the issue occurring even before the reinstall, even in new Composer chats that didn’t contain anything. I hope things work out.\nI hope you have a great day.

        "text": "Yes there is a difference between models. Also not sure which language you use to write prompts. Not every model handles non-english languages the same. While I think in many languages i do use usually english for prompting to avoid issues with different writing system or language.\nToo long cursor rules can cause issues. Sometimes it confuses the AI when it gets too many rules to follow. Thats why Cursor added the new ./cursor/rules .mdc files. Those would be loaded by the description you enter in the cursor settings and by file filter, so only limited number of rules applies.\nSome models are not yet well integrated like o3-mini, Cursor team needs a bit more time to adjust their process to work well with those models.\nI think people here are eager to help others and to share experience to get better at using Cursor and coding with AI. Feel free to share what you feel comfortable with.\nIts sure good to try a simple approach again, perhaps check which models work well with simple prompts and build up to more detailed prompts and rules from that.\nSome users had issues with other extensions loaded into Cursor. But without further information it is hard to tell what could cause it. You can always email Cursor Support, and if you have a Request ID they may be able to see if something hangs on their side. Sometimes it happens.\nIm in same region and had no issues on same device and cursor version using Claude during last days.\nDid you by any chance run out of 500 fast requests?

It made some big changes, noticed the linting errors, then fixed them, asked me to start a script from the terminal,  then read the output and made more changes I and fixed some other linting errors and kept repeating this cycle for 5-10 minutes until it was completely done. By the end it only cost me 1 fast credit for the whole time it re-iterated and tested everything until it was finished.\nI’m used to going back and forth but I think having it write a test script to check the output enabled it to verify its own work and continue on its own. The script was a batch file to start the server, send some data, get a response and check if it matched the required response. I’ll definitely be doing this more often as it saved me an hour.",

You could Tab to accept it mid-sentence, or Cmd+Z to get back to your original thought.\nThis will help users phrase complex requests without breaking their flow and teach effective  prompting skills.\nThe suggestions could use current file context, cursorrules and project details to stay relevant  and the ghost-text styling Zed uses feels lightweight enough to avoid being distracting.  Definitely this task doesn’t require a powerful AI model, cursor-fast or cursor-small model should handle it.\nThis feels like the next logical step in making AI interactions more fluid. What do you think?\nHere is a video that I prepared to see it in action.\nAuto Complete\nThanks for considering!Cheers,",

(If chosen, “Agent” Composer can implicitly access an entire project as context. When asked whether it can access a.gitinore-d directory, it answered yes, and listed the files in that directory.

        "text": "Hello. I encountered a weird bug / limit cap with the R1 model… When I have a complex, hard prompt with either one big file (a few hundred lines of code) or a medium codebase (a few thousand lines of code), R1 initiates the  process, generates all that inner dialogue, and suddenly stops in about 70% of that inner dialogue without a real answer.\nThis seems capped by time or length of the answer, because when I get a short answer from R1 - it is the full answer, but when it is longer than X amount of time, then it is stopped in about the same limit.\nI tried the WiFi router QoS on and off… I tried VPNs with different countries, I tried Cloudflare WARP, and different DNS… I even tried to share my 4G from my smartphone to my laptop and use this connection. Tried to turn off all VS Code/Cursor extensions. Restart PC. Close all other apps. Create a new chat. Create a new compose. Tried to move the project to another folder. Remove and rebuild the index. Have updated Chrome and all other apps and updated Windows 10. I have the latest version of the Cursor, 0.45.4. I never had this issue with other models.\nDon’t have this issue with R1 on OpenRouter with the same files and prompts. I can share in DM/PM my prompt, recorded bug on video, and even my codebase if this helps.\nIf this will not be solved, I want a refund or pause my subscription until it will be resolved (because other models are useless now compared to R1… I rarely use Sonnet 3.5 on some light tasks and never ever benefit from other models, even o1, at least for coding) and possibly add more days to the account because I lost so many days, not just being unable to use Cursor but also trying to deal with that bug.\nBTW, I love Cursor, but there are so many bugs… that I am considering switching to something else (I don’t want to give names here because it will be kinda rude, but one competitor gives $100 free credits for R1 and can be used in open-source IDE alternatives to Cursor. Well, I don’t mind paying for Cursor, but when you have so many bugs and literally free alternative, the choice is probably obvious?).\nIt feels like alpha version 0.4 of the unfinished app, not like a commercial product (all previous bugs with context, issues with code applying, and so on).\nBut even despite all of that, I still love Cursor more than any alternatives, but you guys really should fix all bugs faster, especially in the era of AI when everything is moving so fast and competitors are breathing down your necks.Maybe you should collaborate with open-source devs? It would be a killer!\nP.S. I think this is related toCursor doesn't let R1 think, but I described it in more details.",

(if the model is 687B parameters or so then its not actual DeepSeek R1 , any model of 70B or smaller is actually the LLAMA distilled version.\nDeepSeek R1 was primarily trained using reinforcement learning techniques, focusing on enhancing reasoning capabilities without a prior step of supervised fine-tuning. This method allowed it to achieve reasoning abilities comparable to leading models like OpenAI’s o1. Language training was integrated subsequently to refine its language processing skills",

No one gives a definitive answer (YES or NO) with reasons as to why it should work and things to do fix it (I’ve tried most of what I’ve found in forums with settings OR doesn’t work.\nAre the people in these YouTube videos missing a huge step for the auto updating to work or has something in the Cursor AI to Xcode integration broken ?!\nLastly I’ve seen people post below as an answer to the issue but that seems a very “long winded” way to integrate both products and if this is what you need to do I will give that a passExploring Cursor: Script to Add Files to Xcode From Composer",

        "text": "I wanted to start this post in hopes of encouraging other to share their workflows for incorporating docs and other forms of information into Cursor.I find Github Gists one of the easiest ways to keep things a bit organized as I reuse variations of .cursorrules and .txt files.\nEnhancing Cursor with additional documentation can streamline your workflow. Here’s a guide to incorporating PDFs and GitHub repository content into Cursor:\n1. Adding PDFs to Cursor\nTo integrate PDF content into Cursor, convert the PDF into a text format that Cursor can index:\nConvert the PDF: Use tools likeMarkerto convert your PDF into Markdown. For academic papers, enable full OCR and extract tables, while skipping figures and photos.\nCreate a GitHub Gist: Paste the converted Markdown into a new public Gist on GitHub. After saving, use the “clone as https” option to copy the link.\nAdd to Cursor: In Cursor, use the@Docs > Add New Docfeature to add the Gist link. Assign a name, set the entry point and prefix, and index the document.\nUtilize in Cursor: Access the added document in your prompts using@Docfollowed by the name you assigned. Test it ask it about a very specific section, depending on you task it is a good idea to get an understanding of how well Cursor can use the newly created@Docsfor example can it summarize or extrapolate some meaning.\nOptional: If you use Raycast, consider installing the GitHub Gist extension for easier access and searching your Gists.\n2. Incorporating GitHub Repository Content\nTo add context from a GitHub repository, such as README files and code examples:\nExtract Repository Content: Tools likeuithub.comallow you to extract specific files or folders from a repository. For example, to retrieve only Markdown files, append?ext=mdto the repository URL.\nCreate a Consolidated Gist: Combine the extracted content into a single Markdown file. Ensure the total size is manageable (ideally under 60,000 tokens) to facilitate indexing. After saving as PUBLIC, use the “clone as https” option to copy the link.\nAdd to Cursor: As with PDFs, add the Gist link to Cursor using the@Docs > Add New Docfeature, set the appropriate parameters, and index the document.\nUtilize in Cursor: Reference the document in your prompts using@Docfollowed by the assigned name.\nBy following these steps, you can effectively integrate external documents and repository content into Cursor, enhancing its utility in your development workflow.\nLet say you are building a local KG RAG and you want to use Lightrag. To integrate theLightRAGrepository’s documentation and code examples into Cursor, follow these steps:\n1. Extract Repository Content\nUsinguithub.com: Navigate touithub.comand enter the LightRAG repository URL:https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG.\nFilter for Markdown Files: To retrieve only Markdown files, append?ext=mdto the URL:https://uithub.com/HKUDS/LightRAG?ext=md.\nInclude Specific Folders: To include files from theexamplesdirectory, append?/tree/main/examplesto the URL:https://uithub.com/HKUDS/LightRAG?/tree/main/examples.\n2. Create a Consolidated GitHub Gist\nCombine Extracted Content: Merge the extracted README and example files into a single Markdown document.\nManage Token Size: Ensure the combined content is around 50000 tokens to facilitate successful indexing in Cursor (I often find indexing fails for some reasons, please inform me if you know of Cursors index limits, or other reasons for the fails). It would be helpful if Cursor provided information about the inner workings of the@Docsand indexing process in their own documentation.\nCreate a Public Gist: On GitHub, create a new public Gist namedLightRAG_docs. paste the consolidated content, save it, and save as public, use the “clone as https” option to copy the link\n3. Add the Gist to Cursor\n4. Utilize the Document in Cursor\nso the basics are write a script to convert the needed files to txt or md → create Gist or otherwise host the file so you can add it to Cursor. Tools likeuithub.comis just a nice option, please post similar sites/tools.\nOther options are just writing a basic script, download the repo, convert, host, add to Cursor…",

        "text": "If you plan to utilize information from PDFs, including tables, text, and mathematical formulas, you can consolidate this data into a single .md file. By adding this file to a GitHub Gist and indexing it in Cursor, you can test Cursor’s ability to reference and infer from the content. Using tools like Marker-PDF can assist in extracting tables and mathematical formulas accurately.\nThis is based on information from cursor forums and docs , it might not be accurate. But you might have to change the settings a bit.\nMethod of Adding and Indexing Documentation:\nWhen you open a folder in Cursor, it scans the directory and computes a Merkle tree of hashes for all files, excluding those specified in.gitignoreor.cursorignore. The Merkle tree is then synchronized with Cursor’s servers. Every 10 minutes, Cursor checks for hash mismatches to identify changed files and uploads only those. On the server, files are chunked and embedded, with embeddings stored in a vector database. Each vector is associated with an obfuscated relative file path and corresponding line range.\nLocal vs. Remote Storage:\nWhile Cursor performs local scanning and hashing of your codebase, the embeddings and some metadata are processed and stored on Cursor’s servers. This approach allows for efficient indexing and retrieval but involves cloud storage of certain data. However, Cursor offers a “Privacy Mode” that ensures your code is only stored locally, enhancing security and privacy.\nTesting Cursor’s Inference Capabilities:\nTo test Cursor’s ability to reference and utilize the extracted information, you can:\nBy following these steps, you can determine how well Cursor can leverage external data extracted from PDFs in your coding workflow.\nYou can also try using the .cursorrules pin the docs that way and use chat.Or: Cursor supports the integration of custom AI agents to enhance its functionality. By defining an OpenAI agent tailored to your needs, you can extend Cursor’s capabilities to perform specific tasks or provide specialized assistance. This involves creating configuration files that define the agent’s behavior and adding them to your project within Cursor. Implementing custom agents require experimentation to achieve the desired outcomes.",

If such a webpage is provided to Cursor’s official documentation setup, will Cursor be able to retrieve the content that loads after scrolling down?\nI ask ChatGPT-4o,and get a response as follows:\nWhether Cursor can retrieve content loaded after scrolling primarily depends on how it fetches webpage content:\nStatic Fetching MethodIf Cursor only fetches the HTML returned when the page initially loads (i.e., it does not execute JavaScript), then it will only obtain the initial portion of the content. The content that is dynamically loaded through scrolling will not be included.\nDynamic Rendering MethodIf Cursor employs technology similar to a headless browser that can execute JavaScript and simulate user scrolling, it might be able to load and capture the additional content that appears after scrolling down.\nTherefore, if you supply such dynamically loaded official docs to Cursor’s documentation setup, you need to ensure that:\nIn summary, by default, many documentation fetching tools only capture the statically loaded initial content, and dynamic content typically requires additional handling. If Cursor’s settings are not specifically adjusted for dynamic content, it may only retrieve the initial content and miss the parts loaded after scrolling.\nSo, in Cursor’s settings, when referencing official documentation, which method does it use? How can I make Cursor retrieve the entire docs from such a dynamically changing URL?",

And have it provide me it’s understanding of the project before I proceed. Now when I do that it seems to not understand anymore and hallucinates immediately on the first message.\nAny ideas or advice for how to work around these limitations?\nLimiting it to just one or 2 scripts of context is not enough because this is a highly complex project that requires a lot of context for any change.\nThanks in advance for your helpful constructive responses",

Today, i get the same .js issue as a ton of other people.\nWhen running Cursor on **Windows 11** with a project stored in the **Linux envir…onment (WSL)**, an issue occurs during system shutdown. The workflow involves using **Docker Compose** inside WSL while storing Docker data on the **Windows host machine**.  \n\n#### Steps to Reproduce  \n1. Open Cursor within a project located in WSL.  \n2. Build or run the project using **Docker Compose** inside WSL, with Docker stored on the Windows host.  \n3. Close everything and attempt to shut down the system.  \n4. Windows displays a message stating that Cursor is still installing, preventing shutdown.  \n5. After **forcing the shutdown** and restarting the system, the following message appears:  \n   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41e64dca-43b7-4ed9-bb6d-323b0682f6db)  \n\n#### Observed Behavior  \n- Cursor appears **installed**, with its **icon and folders present**, but **cannot be uninstalled** via **Control Panel** or **Start Menu**.  \n- Running the Cursor installer again is the **only way** to use it, as it installs over the existing (broken) installation. \n\n*This is my experience; it may vary, but I have noticed this issue since I started using these services.*\nUntil yesterday, I was using the cursor well.\nToday, when I turned on my comput…er and launched the cursor, I got an error like the one in the image, and the cursor wouldn't launch.\nWhy is this happening?\n\nI've been coding with the cursor in vscode, and I'm very confused.\nI would be grateful if you could tell me the cause.\n\nI'm running on Windows 10.(ryzen 5800X, memory 32GB)\n\n![092](https://github.com/getcursor/cursor/assets/589351/346e1f5c-3202-4664-8134-888eceb89f1a)",

Would be nice to add a cleaning of this ( an other common paths ) replacing for geek and funny names, maybe Disney wouldn’t allow to use The Star Wars characters but I am sure you can find something useful.\n\nin this image you see “joaomoura” that could be personal usernames or maybea hommage toJoão (Joe) Moura - crewAI | LinkedInthe cool brazilian that built crew.ai agentic framework,or just licensed training data…\nkeep up the good work,\nThanks,Páris",

Kind of got it working but decided not to include it in this release until I can figure out a better solution. I was completely hands off on the code base until the end, when I needed to polish some of the more serious bugs. (There’s still quite a few to fix)\nMost important for me was the search - I wanted to be able to search across all the tracks, albums and artists and be able to find them quickly and I was really happy that Cursor was able to implement it within minutes.\nPages like albums and artists are paginated automatically.\nAlbum Page1299×729 66.3 KB\nI wanted to put more images, but couldn’t attach em.\nYou can head over tomy github page herefor instructions on how to run it if you want to!

I didn’t know if my account was going to be charged for the same capacity next month because it’s not clear on the page how the billing works so I dialed it back down because I’m almost finished my project.\nI thought I would still have the extra credits to burn through but then I got back into the slow requests queue and it seemed even slower than before-- I was waiting for around 2-4 minutes for a response.\nBut I couldn’t go back to raise fast requests (see screenshot).\nSo then I enabled usage-based pricing and added my Anthropic Key to the project.  It showed I used $0.00/$50 limit on the dashboard, but then Cursor showed me that I hit the limit with my API key.\nCursor has been a coding juggernaut for me for the past several months and unfortunately, I’m now at almost a pause and slow crawl with it.  I had to revert back to disabled usage-based pricing too.\nHow can I resolve this?\np.s. Thank you so much for this wonderful tool!  I’ve recently explored W1ndsurf and, while I feel it’s more affordable and does some things really well, Cursor still is a lot more intelligent in how it does many things, and faster too, especially with  more context.\nScreenshot 2025-02-04 at 9.02.46 PM2454×1556 274 KB\np.p.s. Wow, I can’t have the word “W1ndsurf” in my post?  I think you guys can do a little better with that.  It can be helpful to compare things that other tools do well so you have a model to follow.  Banning a term like that seems unintellectual.",

        "text": "Seems like you’ve had a slew of less-than-optimal experiences here, but let me try to explain it all!\nWith our old fast requests packages, they would by default renew monthly. If you still have >500 fast requests on your account, that will keep renewing at the same price.\nThe slow queue gets longer the more you use it, but using more fast requests won’t add to how long the time is; it is only slow.\nAs you have seen, we have switched to usage-based pricing to simplify our plan and avoid people paying for requests they don’t use. With this system, you pay $0.04 for each request you use. We will bill you at the start of each month for what you used previously unless you hit $20, in which case we will invoice you immediately to ensure users don’t use $100s of usage without paying for it.\nWith usage-based pricing, you don’t need to add an API key, that is a separate feature. If you add an API key, the key will be used over the usage-based pricing, so the costs of your requests would go to Anthropic, not us. It’s best to decide one way or the other with this usually.\nThe errors you see regarding your API key are due to your key having lower limits from Anthropic - this isn’t us imposing the limit! If you use usage-based pricing, you won’t see these issues.",

        "text": "New Title Suggestion: “Revolutionize Text Input with Whisper Dictation”\nImagine hands-free text entry that’s not only fast, but incredibly accurate. Whisper’s cutting-edge voice dictation technology, powered by OpenAI, offers a superior alternative to the standard built-in speech-to-text solutions. With its ability to handle complex vocabulary and provide greater accuracy, Whisper can truly transform the way we interact with our favorite editor. I’m asking the Cursor team to consider integrating support for Whisper dictation.\nWhy this feature matters:\n•Unmatched Accuracy:Whisper outperforms traditional dictation tools, significantly reducing the need for corrections.\n•Flexibility and Choice:Users could either access OpenAI’s Whisper API or connect a locally hosted Whisper model, depending on their preferences and workflow.\nWhat I’m requesting:\nSeamless integration of OpenAI’s Whisper API for top-tier dictation capabilities.\nSupport for locally hosted Whisper models, providing more options for privacy-conscious users.\nLet’s bring unparalleled voice-to-text performance to our editor and make text entry effortless and precise!\nMockupCleanShot 2025-01-23 at 12.48.47@2x926×300 28.1 KB",

The globs are the most precise way to define this, but your description for each should be a statement the AI can use to decide if the rule is needed, such as:\n“Always use this rule”“Use this rule when creating frontend React files”\" Use this rule when planning a new feature\"\nWith a bit of experimentation, you’ll find what works best for you!",

ChooseApplicationas the format and save it in the Applications folder with the name “Cursor Launcher” (or any name you prefer).\nNow, you can drag the icon from the Applications folder to the Dock. I’ve placed it right next to the Cursor icon.\nThat’s it! Dragging a folder to this new icon will open it in Cursor.\nNote:\nThis script worked perfectly for me, but I’ve never worked with Mac’s Script Editor before. You might need to tweak the script depending on your macOS version or system configuration.\nI hope this works as a temporary solution until Cursor implements this functionality.",

Happened again in the middle of a huge session, no warning.\n0.45.9 does not seem to be a healthy build and it seems that 0.45.8 has an aggressive update strategy on Linux.\nIn summary\n0.45.8 auto updated even when I said no to the popup on the bottom\nThe first time I intentionally updated from 0.45.8 and found out 0.45.9 is not a good build and reverted.\nSecond time it auto updated when I simply clicked on “read change log”.\nThird time it auto updated without me touching the “Update Cursor” panel.\nSince I had been burned twice I knew to keep an eye on the update and not to trust it. But, when I restarted Cursor I noticed it had replaced itself (since my symbolic ~/bin/cursor app failed).\nHad I not restarted I would have drilled another session into the void due to it auto updating from 0.45.8 to 0.45.9.\nMy solution is to go to the main website and download from the main “DOWNLOAD” link which has always been 0.45.8 during this time of oddness.   I now keep an hidden backup of 0.45.8 so that when the system replaces itself with the errant build, I can subvert it.\nThis requires me keeping an eye on things way more than I would like, of course.\nCursor is an amazing tool and but this  bug is not sparking joy or confidence atm.

I don’t know or care to track down the root cause. All I know is running “SFC /scannow” resolved it for me and I haven’t had the issue since.

You’ll see that the AppData is missing, but navigating to %AppData%..\\Local\\cursor-update\\ and check for pending if you have an update.INSTALL THE UPDATE FROM HEREDo not keep downloading the version from their website as it’s not the “current” version so you end up in the same loop.  I’m not sure as I haven’t put a trace on it, but I think when there’s a pending update and you close (shutdown which I often go straight to shutdown) with a pending update, cursor tries to install it, removes the old (current) version and then times out, (in my case I’m shutting down the PC) so the update doesn’t get a chance to install.  This way you are “manually” installing the current updated version.  This is obviously a bug they need to fix but hopefully this gives you a work around as the version on the site is old and just keeps you in this never fully updated loop!\nIn there I have a JSON file showing an updated version\nimage1095×618 24.6 KB\nIt also helps if you add both %APPDATA%\\Local\\Cursor and cursor-update to your A\\V Exclusions, navigate to Windows → Settings → Security → Virus & Threat Protection → Manage Settings → Exclusions → Add both%AppData%\\Roaming\\Cursor%APPDATA%\\Local\\Programs\\cursor%APPDATA%\\Local\\cursor-update\nGood Luck~ Bizanator",

I’ll add my thoughts for some of the items you brought up.\nONE. I think the biggest use case is providing the AI with more context about your project. I work on a massive codebase and so most of my.cursorrulesis explaining the “high level view”. Secondary purpose is customizing how the AI agent behaves; I tell mine to be concise and not give examples unless I explicitly ask, in an effort to be more efficient with my context window. (I put this in Rules for AI section).\nTHREE. No idea, but mine is in YAML format and it seems to work well\nFIVE. I don’t think so. I never @ it and it seems to be working. A good idea is to add something likeStart every message with \"Howdy, partner!\"to the rules file to make sure it’s working.\nAs for the lack of documentation… I think it’s because we’re in such a crazy wild wild west era of rapid AI expansion. No one really understands the capabilities or best practices and every few days those things change as more powerful models are released. Developers using Cursor are gonna experiment and the “best practices” will change a lot depending on your use case (massive existing codebase, constant new small projects, etc).",

        "text": "two things.\n(00:44:43)And we have this one system internally that we call Preempt, which helps us with that a little bit. And I think it was built for the era before where we had 8,000 token contact windows. And it’s a little bit similar to when you’re making a website. You want it to work on mobile, you want it to work on a desktop screen, and you have this dynamic information which you don’t have. For example, if you’re designing a print magazine, you know exactly where you can put stuff. But when you have a website or when you have a prompt, you have these inputs and then you need to format them to always work, even if the input is really big, then you might have to cut something down. And so the idea was, okay, let’s take some inspiration. What’s the best way to design websites? Well, the thing that we really like is React and the declarative approach where you use JSX in JavaScript, and then you declare, “This is what I want and I think this has higher priority or this has higher Z index than something else.”\n(00:45:56)And then you have this rendering engine in web design. It’s like Chrome, and in our case it’s a preempt renderer, which then fits everything onto the page. And as you declare, decide what you want and then it figures out what you want. And so we have found that to be quite helpful and I think the role of it has shifted over time where initially it was to fit to these small context windows. Now it’s really useful because it helps us with splitting up the data that goes into the prompt and the actual rendering of it. And so it’s easier to debug because you can change the rendering of the prompt and then try it on old prompts because you have the raw data that went into the prompt, and then you can see, “Did my change actually improve it for this entire eval set?”\nLex(00:46:45)So do you literally prompt with JSX?\nAman(00:46:48)Yes. Yes.\nArvid(00:46:48)Yeah. So it looks like react. There are components. We have one component that’s a file component and it takes in the cursor. Usually there’s one line where the cursor is in your file and that’s probably the most important line because that’s the one you’re looking at. And so then you can give priorities. So that line has the highest priority, and then you subtract one for every line that is farther away. And then eventually when it’s rendered, it figures out how many lines can actually fit and it centers around that thing.\nLex(00:47:17)That’s amazing.\nAman(00:47:18)And you can do other fancy things where if you have lots of code blocks from the entire code base, you could use retrieval and things like embedding and re-ranking scores to add priorities for you through these components.\nLex(00:47:30)So should humans when they ask questions, also try to use something like that? Would it be beneficial to write JSX in the problem or the whole idea is this should be loose and messy?\nArvid(00:47:43)I think our goal is that you should just do whatever is the most natural thing for you, and then our job is to figure out how do we actually retrieve the relative event things so that your thinking actually makes sense?\nLex(00:47:56)Well, this is the discussion I had with Aravind of Perplexity is his whole idea is you should let the person be as lazy as he wants. That’s a beautiful thing, but I feel like you’re allowed to ask more of programmers, right?\nArvid(00:48:14)Yes.\nLex(00:48:14)So if you say, “Just do what you want,” humans are lazy. There’s a tension between just being lazy versus provide more as be prompted… Almost like the system pressuring you or inspiring you to be articulate. Not in terms of the grammar of the sentences, but in terms of the depth of thoughts that you convey inside the prompts.\nAman(00:48:39)I think even as a system gets closer to some level of perfection, often when you ask the model for something, not enough intent is conveyed to know what to do. And there are a few ways to resolve that intent. One is the simple thing of having the model just ask you, “I’m not sure how to do these parts based on your query. Could you clarify that?” I think the other could be maybe if there are five or six possible generations, “Given the uncertainty present in your query so far, why don’t we just actually show you all of those and let you pick them?”\nLex(00:49:19)How hard is it for the model to choose to talk back versus generally… It’s hard, how deal with the uncertainty. Do I choose to ask for more information to reduce the ambiguity?\nSualeh(00:49:36)So one of the things we do, it’s like a recent addition, is try to suggest files that you can add. And while you’re typing, one can guess what the uncertainty is and maybe suggest that maybe you’re writing your API and we can guess using the commits that you’ve made previously in the same file that the client and the server is super useful and there’s a hard technical problem of how do you resolve it across all commits? Which files are the most important given your current prompt? And we’re still initial version is ruled out and I’m sure we can make it much more accurate. It’s very experimental, but then the idea is we show you, do you just want to add this file, this file, this file also to tell the model to edit those files for you?\n(00:50:37)Because if maybe you’re making the API, you should also edit the client and the server that is using the API and the other one resolving the API. So that would be cool as both there’s the phase where you’re writing a prompt and there’s… Before you even click, “Enter,” maybe we can help resolve some of the uncertainty.",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\nI’m facing an authentication challenge with our MCP integration in Cursor and would appreciate your insights.\nWe have an MCP server built with FastAPI that exposes our “chat” tool via SSE. For our web UI (powered by NextAuth), we rely on Google authentication to ensure the proper username and email context. However, when it comes to the MCP connection from Cursor, the usual Google OAuth flow isn’t triggering, leaving us without an authenticated user context on the server.\nIn essence, while our MCP server expects Google OAuth credentials (either via an external flow or token injection), Cursor’s MCP client currently appears not to support custom auth headers, token injection, or automatic redirection to a Google login page. We’re exploring options like:\nHas anyone successfully tackled this issue or have recommendations on integrating Google authentication with MCP in Cursor? Any pointers on workarounds or upcoming features would be greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "I keep running into an issue in which Cursor Chat will remove/prune references to files (via@file) after the request is sent, resulting in the file contents not being read by the LLM in the response.\nIt’s gotten to the point where I encounter this issue multiple times per chat session and is easily the most glaring problem I’ve encountered with Cursor to date. It’s also a very subtle problem that’s easy to miss for new users- I only realized this was happening after LLM responses severely degraded in quality recently, only to discover it was because Cursor was removing half of the files I was attaching to its chat context.\nFrom my limited knowledge, it appears to be a frontend/client-side issue rather than a backend issue, as Cursor appears to prune specific attached files from the request as it’s submitted in the chat client itself with no rhyme or reason. Despite being extremely hard to reproduce, I’ll to my best to elaborate with an example of this behavior:\nLet’s say I start a new chat and write the following prompt with a few files attached:\nDespite the three files appearing to be properly attached, some appear to be sporadically pruned once the request is actually submitted:\nThis can also usually be confirmed in the LLM response, which will typically be something like:\nThis can also be further confirmed by attempting to paste the contents of files into a new chat message- the contents of files that Cursor reads (i.eexample-file-1.ts,example-file-3.ts) will result in the file’s context being automatically attached via the shortened@[filename]macro, but problematic files likeexample-file-2.tsthat get omitted will just have their entire plaintext content pasted directly into the chat message box.\nI’ll try to record a video showing the behavior when I get a chance.\nFor the sake of thoroughness, here’s absolutely every variable I’ve ruled out:\nHere’s some information about my environment:\nThe only potential variable I’ve noticed is that it seems to occur most often in projects that use javascript frameworks like Astro and Vue, although that might just be selection bias as that tends to be what I work with most often these days. Plus, I’ve seen this behavior with all matters of file extensions, from.txtto.py- not just.vueor.astrofiles.\nAny ideas? Is this user error, or is this a commonly reported issue?",

R1 seems to take some user prompts on Perplexity very literally, eg my prompt for Sonnet which was designed so URLs will be outputted as raw URLs, with R1 it forces the model to respond only with list of URLs. So from this I would guess R1 might need more special system prompt tailored just for R1.",

But sometimes not enough\nmaybe I’m generating something and I like what agent did, but I don’t like where it’s heading. Since it’s in agent mode, I would have to wait until it’s finished to accept everything, and come back to where I really wanted to be.Because if I click stop or cancel it will remove everything it has done until now…\nIf it had a ‘Pause’ button that would be very cool to be able to\nI would like this feature!What do you guys think??\nHave a nice day,Diane",

I had Claude 3.5 Sonnet selected as my assistant the entire time and never switched to OpenAI models. But then, when an error occurred, the message said:\n“Unable to reach OpenAI. Try again.”\nWhy is an OpenAI-related error popping up when I’veonly used Claude?\nThis raises some questions:\nIs Cursor making hidden API requests to OpenAI in the background, even if you select Claude?\nAre some features still relying on OpenAI despite user settings?\nOr is this just a UI bug that incorrectly labels errors?\nIf they’re routing requests to OpenAI without clear disclosure, that’s a transparency issue. Users should know exactly where their prompts are going,especially when working in an AI-assisted coding environment.\nHas anyone else noticed this? Would love to hear thoughts from the community and maybe even some clarification from Cursor’s team.\nScreenshot 2025-02-05 at 10.03.361252×1478 134 KB",

It was really nice.\nHowever, I am not switching at the moment and the reason is the installation. I don’t want to worry about installation or waste time solving problems with it - in this point copilot is currently perfect and it also has a pycharm / intelliJ plugin, something cursor doesn’t.\nI would love to be informed in case you solve the installation for Ubuntu making it simpler and maintainable.\nThanks!",

But (and there’s always a “but,” right?), I’ve got a little suggestion that I think could take this already stellar editor to a whole new orbit.\nDrumroll please…\nHow about adding support forJupyter Notebooksdirectly inside Cursor?\nI mean, think about it! One editor to rule them all! Data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, and pretty much anyone who lives and breathes Python would be over the moon. Imagine being able to write code, run cells, visualize data, and document all in this sleek, modern interface you’ve crafted.\nNo more jumping between tools. No more context switching. Just one beautifully unified environment where we can get stuff done.\nPlus, you’d make alotof nerdy data people (myself included) very, very happy! So, what do you think? Jupyter + Cursor = dream team?\nLooking forward to what’s next!\nMuch love,Mario",

However, it’s free to use and Cursor seems to integrate with it already (according tothis discussion).\nTechnically, marketplaces are typically not “hosting” extensions they arelinkingto them. This is important from a legal perspective.\nI don’t know what/how Cursor is doing it. However, based on other forum questions and answers it seems that there is some process which scans the VS Code marketplaces for new (and/or updated?) extensions and publishes them on the Cursor marketplace. The process maybe automated or run manually. I don’t know.\nI think from a compliance perspective you can implement such a process/tool as a VS Code extension. Thismightnot be in violation of the VS Code marketplace terms posted above because technically VS Code would be connecting to the marketplace. However, it may become complicated if some API is missing and the extension would need to initiate network connections to the marketplace directly.\nThere could have also been negotiations with Microsoft to allow Cursor such synchronization (perhaps for a percentage of revenue). It’s possible as well. But I could not find any published information. Thus, just speculating here.\nHowever, one thing that’s possibly a gray area is the implicit consent from extension authors. On Open VSX an extension author has to publish themselves. Thus, there is explicit action needed by an extension author to publish its extension. Cursor just seems to do it without asking/checking with the author. I think most authors would be fine with the implicit consent. But there might be a few which are not. That’s why I say it’s a gray area.\nThus, I recommend Cursor userscarefully checkingan extension terms and conditions. I believe some extension are not open source and only allow use within VS Code. I looked at this when considering a VS Code fork for a project. I decided against it basically it meant losing all remote development capabilities (their terms allow use within VS Code only).",

        "text": "Hello,\nI’ve searched a bit to try and resolve this but in my main project cursor just started not letting me type into the chat window to provide a prompt.\nIt does however let me type into composer.\nOn my own I did the obvious things, restart the app, computer, window. Reloaded the window with extensions disabled etc. Still blocked typing into the typearea.\nStarted researching and found some people had issues with regular copilot installed or copilot++ I dont even have those extensions and I tested with all extensions disabled.\nSome people said open a new window. And I did this and it works! However, as soon as I open the same project it stops working again making me believe it’s something project specific.\nI can see in the chat section that it saves my previous chats for the project folder so I’m guessing theres some sort of internal project cache. I couldn’t find where to clear this and if it was something stored in the folder itself.\nSo I duplicated the project folder in Windows and opened that in cursor. No issue with typing. So its for sure something with the project/cache etc.\nI sawthis threadbut it magically resolved for them and they didn’t provide details.\n@amanrsYou were looking into that thread with the same issue. Please let me know if you’d like me to provide my log file or do a call as you suggested in the other thread.\nFor the moment, I will work within my cloned folder and update if it stops working\nWindows 11 Home i9 Laptop PC.Latest cursor, cursor about log:Version: 0.43.5VSCode Version: 1.93.1Commit: 2eaa79a1b14ccff5d1c78a2c358a08be16a8e5a0Date: 2024-11-27T09:11:51.854ZElectron: 30.5.1Chromium: 124.0.6367.243Node.js: 20.16.0V8: 12.4.254.20-electron.0OS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.22631",

I have Cursor installed in the three systems, however, it seems the versions do not match.\nOn the laptop I use most, I was prompted a week or two ago about updating to the latest v0.45 version.\nHowever, it seems my other computer still has v0.44 installed in both systems, I’ve tried to attempt to update using the command palette but so far, it hasn’t worked. I believe that Cursor updates are rolled out little by little, but it is a bit of a weird experience to have two different versions for the same Cursor account.\nOne of the “issues” I’ve encountered is that I had changed the .cursorrules in one of my repos to .cursor/rules, but after switching to my desktop computer, I have had to change it back to .cursorrules since in this computer cursor is still in v0.44.\nI think it’d be great if updates were rolled out to accounts/organizations to avoid these problems.\nIf I’m wrong in any way, please let me know so I can update hahaha.\nAgain though, my experience so far has been really good, so kudos to the Cursor team!",

They are automatically added via the glob pattern or the agent recognising they are relevant from the rule description.\nUnlike.cursorrules, which is auto-added to any chat/composer interaction, these project-specific rules will only be added to the context when they are relevant (via the glob pattern or agent thinking it is, based on your project description).",

After I configured my.cursorignoreto add negations for the./tmpdir, resyncing the index resulted in the files in./tmpbeing picked up.\nI’m still unable to getanythingthat’s in tmp as an @ Symbol.\nHowever,when I comment out the tmp dir in .gitignore, I’m able to use the @ Symbols! It looks as if Cursor has a blocklist for all files covered in .gitignore when it comes to @ Symbols, even if .cursorignore negates them and allows them to be indexed. Can you confirm this is the case? If so, can we update Cursor to respect the negated files in .cursorignore?",

I’m disappointed that it doesn’t work in the Agent mode though. I use it extensively in a few custom agents that I have developed for work, and it does great with function and tool calling, and complying with prompt instructions. I expect it would work well in the agent tool.\nIs the limitation of Anthropic/GPT4o in the agent driven by performance, configuration of schemas/prompts, or by costs?\nI would prefer a warning that the agent ‘may’ not work with a given model, instead of not allowing me to try and find out.",

Sonnet is fantastic but there are many tasks where sonnet is an overkill and I like to use stuff like deepseek for these simpler tasks. Gemini - especiall the 1206 exp and flash thinking - is pretty good at this too and has faster responses usually than deepseek used by cursor, so I would like to use it occasionally but it is so hit and miss that it is a waste of time to use it. Frequently it generates code that cursor straight up can’t apply. I don’t see this issue when using it with aider, where it is able to apply the generated diffs well enough.\nIs the cursor team working on better integrating gemini with cursor?\nThanks.",

        "text": "I have an issue with Cursor’s undo functionality. When I use CMD+K to get AI assistance and write text in the Cursor window, that text becomes part of my code’s undo history. This means when I later use CMD+Z to undo changes in my code, I have to go through all the text I wrote in the Cursor window first.\nI’d prefer if the Cursor window text wasn’t included in my code’s undo history - similar to how using Claude’s web UI doesn’t affect my code history. Is there a way to make CMD+K interactions separate from the main code undo history?",
